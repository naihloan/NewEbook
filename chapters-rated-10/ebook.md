How strongly I recommend it: **10**/10\
**(See [my list of 200+ books](/book), for more.)**

Absolutely everyone who is an entrepreneur or wants to be one needs to
read this book. I first read it after 10 years of successfully running
my company, and was still blown away and totally humbled by its wisdom.
Re-reading it today, I\'m amazed how my view of business was completely
changed by this one little book. See my notes for examples, but
definitely read the book itself to get the real impact.

my notes
--------

Fatal assumption : if you understand the technical work of a business,
you understand a business that does that technical work.\
The technical work of a business, and a business that does that
technical work are two totally different things.\
The technician is forced to learn how to make the business work, rather
than do the work himself.\
\
Every technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure experiences
the same thing:\
1. Exhiliration, 2. Terror, 3. Exhaustion, 4. Despair - a terrible sense
of loss, loss of special relationship with their work, loss of purpose,
loss of self.\
\
\
== ENTREPRENEUR, MANAGER, TECHNICIAN\
\
Everybody who goes into business is actually three people in one:\
The Entrepreneur dreams\
The Manager frets\
The Technician ruminates\
While each of these personalities wants to be the boss, none of them
wants to have a boss.\
\
The Entrepreneur lives in the future, never in the past, rarely in the
present. He\'s happiest when left free to construct images of \"what
if\" and \"if when\".\
In business, the Entrepreneur is the innovator, grand strategist,
creator of new methods.\
Given his need for change, the Entrepreneur creates a great deal of
havoc around him, which is predictably unsettling for those he enlists
in his projects.\
The entrepreneur builds a house and the instant it\'s done begins
planning the next one.\
\
The Manager craves order, compulsively clings to the status quo. While
entrepreneur sees opportunities, manager sees the problems.\
The Manager creates neat orderly rows of things. The Entrepreneur
creates the things that the manager puts in rows.\
The Manager is the one who runs after the Entrepreneur to clean up the
mess. Without the Entrepreneur there would be no mess to clean up.\
\
Technician is the doer : \"if you want something done right, do it
yourself\".\
As long as the Technician is working, he is happy, but only on one thing
at a time. He knows he can\'t get things done simultaneously, so he
works steadily and is happiest when he is in control of the work flow.\
\
If the three were equally balanced, we\'d be describing an incredibly
competent individual.\
The Entrepreneur would be free to forge ahead into new areas of
interest.\
The Manager would be solidifying the base of operations.\
The Technician would be doing the technical work.\
\
Without all three of these personalities being given opportunity, the
freedom, the nourishment they each need to grow, your business cannot
help but mirror your own lopsidedness.\
\
An Entrepreneur does the work of envisioning the business as something
apart from you, the owner. The work of asking all the right questions
about WHY this business, opposed to that business?\
\
\
== INFANCY\
\
Unfortunately most business do what the owner wants as opposed to what
the business needs.\
It\'s easy to spot a business in infancy : the owner and business are
one and the same.\
Infancy ends when the owner realizes the business cannot continue to run
the way it has been, that to survive it will have to change. This is
where most business failures occur.\
\
If your business depends on you, you don\'t own a business - you have a
job. (and you\'re working for a lunatic)\
The purpose of going into business is to get free of a job so you can
create jobs for other people.\
\
== ADOLESCENCE\
\
Error: Management by abdication (\"To relinquish formally a high office
or responsibility.\") rather than delegation.\
The process of deterioration where the number of the balls in the air is
not only too much for you, but too much for your people as well.\
\
\
== BEYOND THE COMFORT ZONE\
\
True trust comes from knowing, not from blind faith.\
To know, one must understand.\
To understand, one must have an intimate awareness of what conditions
are truly present. What people know, do, want, are - and what they
don\'t/aren\'t.\
A business that \"gets small again\" is a business reduced to the level
of its owner\'s personal resistance to change - its owner\'s comfort
zone. (works and waits for something positive to happen)\
Businesses that \"get small again\" die, implode.\
Your job is to prepare yourself and your business for growth.\
To educate yourself so that, as your business grows, the foundation and
structure can carry the additional weight.\
\*\* It\'s up to you to dictate your business\'s rate of growth by
understanding the key processes that need to be performed, the key
objectives that need to be achieved, the key position you\'re aiming for
in the marketplace.\
Write it down, clearly, so others can understand it. (If you can\'t, you
don\'t own it!)\
\
\
== MATURITY\
\
Maturity is not an inevitable result of the first two phases. It is not
the end of a serial process. Great companies didn\'t end up as mature
companies - they started out that way.\
Mature company must also go through infancy and adolescence, but go
through them in a different way. It\'s the perspective that makes the
difference.\
Very clear picture of what the company would look like when it was done.
How it would act.\
Unless you act that way from the beginning, you\'ll never get there. In
order to become a great company, act like a great company long before it
ever becomes one.\
Every day at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing
business. We didn\'t do business at IBM, we built one.\
The very best businesses are fashioned after a model of a business that
works.\
\
How must the business work?\
Business as a system for producing outside results - for the customer -
resulting in profits.\
Picture of a well-defined future, then comes back to the present with
the intention of changing it to match the vision.\
\
Survey the world and ask, \"Where is the opportunity?\"\
Identify it, then go back to the drawing board and construct a solution
to the frustration found in a group of customers.\
Acts the way the customer needs it to act, not the Entrepreneur.\
\"How will my business look to the customer?\" \"How will my business
stand out from all the rest?\"\
Within the customer is a continuing parade of changing wants, begging to
be satisfied. Find out what those wants are, and what they will be in
the future.\
\
\
== THE TURN-KEY REVOLUTION / FRANCHISE PROTOTYPE\
\
A systems-dependent business, not a people-dependent business.\
Integrity : doing what you say you will do, and if you can\'t : learning
how.\
\
Franchise prototype is where all assumptions are put to the test to see
how well they work before becoming operational in the business.\
The system runs the business. The people run the system.\
The system isn\'t something you bring to the business. It\'s something
you derive from the process of building the business.\
Entrepreneur : franchise prototype is the medium through which vision
takes form in the real world.\
Manager : franchise prototype provides the order, predictability,
system.\
Technician : franchise prototype is where he is free to do the things he
loves to do : the technical work.\
\
\
== WORKING ON YOUR BUSINESS, NOT IN IT\
\
Your business is not your life.\
Your business is something apart from you, with its own rules and its
own purposes. An organism that will live or die according to how well it
performs its sole function : find and keep customers.\
The primary purpose of your business is to serve your life (not
vice-versa)\
Make a perfect prototype for 5000 more just like it. Exactly like it,
not just similar.\
Franchise model:\
1. provides consistent value to customers, employees, etc - beyond what
they expect\
2. operated by people with the lowest possible skill\
3. a place of impecable order\
4. all work documented in operations manuals\
5. provides uniformly predictable service to the customer\
6. uses uniform color, dress, facilities code\
\
Lowest possible level of skill necessary to fulfill the functions for
which each is intended. Of course, in a legal firm you need attorneys,
medical, physicians. But you don\'t need to hire brilliant attorneys or
physicians.\
Create the very best system through which good attorneys and good
physicians can be leveraged to produce exquisite results.\
\
How can I give my customer the results he wants systematically rather
than personally?\
How can I create a business whose results are systems-dependent rather
than people-dependent or expert-dependent?\
How can I create an expert system rather than hire one?\
\
Great business are not built by extraordinary people, but by ordinary
people doing extraordinary things.\
\
Develop those tools and teach your people how to use them.\
People\'s job is to use the tools you\'ve developed and recommend
improvements based on their experience with them.\
\
NO : Typical owner of a small business prefers highly skilled people
because he believes they make his job easier - he can simply leave the
work to them.\
Unfortunately then the business grows to depend on the whims and moods
of its people.\
If they\'re in the mood, the job gets done. If they\'re not, it
doesn\'t.\
In this kind of business, \"How do I motivate my people?\" comes up :
\"How do I keep them in the mood?\"\
It is literally impossible to create a consistent result in a business
that depends on extraordinary people.\
When you intentionally build your business around the skills of ordinary
people, you will be forced to ask the difficult questions about how to
produce a result without the extraordinary ones.\
You will be forced to find a system that leverages your ordinary people
to the point where they can produce extraordinary results over and over
again.\
You will be forced to invent innovative system solutions to the people
problems that plague businesses.\
You will be forced to build a business that works.\
\
Documentation says, \"This is how we do it here.\"\
Without documentation, all routinized work turns into exceptions.\
Designates the purpose of the work, specifies the steps needed to be
taken while doing that work, and summarizes the standards associated
with both the process and result.\
\
BARBER story : He was constantly and arbitrarily changing my experience
for me. He was in control of my experience, not I. Running the business
for him, not me. Deprived me of the experience of making a decision to
patronize his business for my own reasons. It didn\'t matter what I
wanted.\
What you do in your model is not as important as doing what you do the
same way, each and every time.\
\
\* How can I get my business to work without me?\
\* How can I get my people to work without my interference?\
\* How can I systematize my business so it could be replicated thousands
of times?\
\* How can I own my business, and still be free of it?\
\* How can I spend my time doing the work I love to do rather than the
work I have to do?\
\
\
== BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\
\
People constantly asking, \"What is the best way to do this?\" - knowing
we\'ll never discover the best way, but by asking we discover a better
way.\
Innovation is the \"best way\" skill. It produces a high level of energy
in every company.\
\
Quantification : numbers related to the impact an innovation makes.\
Quantify EVERYTHING related to how you do business.\
Eventually, you and your people will think of your entire business in
terms of the numbers.\
Read your business\' health chart by the flow of the numbers.\
Know which numbers are critical and which aren\'t.\
Become as familiar with your business\' numbers as a doctor is with
blood pressure / pulse rates.\
Without the numbers, you don\'t know where you are or where you\'re
going.\
With the numbers, your business will take on a totally new meaning.\
\
Orchestration is the elimination of discretion or choice at the
operating level of your business.\
Without orchestration, nothing could be planned or anticipated by you or
your customer.\
If you\'re doing everything differently every time you do it, if
everyone is doing it at their own discretion, you\'re creating chaos,
not order.\
If you haven\'t orchestrated it, you don\'t own it.\
If you don\'t own it, you can\'t depend on it.\
Unless your unique way of doing business can be replicated every single
time, you don\'t own it.\
Unless your customer gets everything he wants every time, he\'ll go
someplace else to get it.\
The business development process is not static - it\'s not something you
do and then are done with - it\'s something you do all the time.\
\
Innovation, Quantification, Orchestration are the backbone of a business
- the Business Development Process.\
\
\
== BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\
\
Your\...\
1. Primary Aim\
2. Strategic Objective\
3. Organizational Strategy\
4. Management Strategy\
5. People Strategy\
6. Marketing Strategy\
7. Systems Strategy\
\
== PRIMARY AIM:\
What do I value most?\
What kind of life do I want?\
What do I want my life to look like, to feel like?\
How do I wish my day-to-day to be?\
What would I like to be able to say I truly know in my life, about my
life?\
Who do I wish to be?\
How would I like to be with other people in my life : my family,
friends, business associates, customers, employees?\
How would I like people to think about me?\
2 years from now? 10? 20? End of life?\
What specifically would I like to learn during my life : spiritually,
physically, financially, technically, intellectually, about
relationships?\
\
Begin living your life as if it were important. Take it seriously.
Create it intentionally.\
\
== STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:\
\
Your strategic objective is a very clear statement of what your business
has to ultimately do for you to achieve your primary aim.\
\
The first standard is gross revenues. How big will your company be when
it\'s finally done? Know your gross profits, pretax profits, after-tax
profits.\
You can\'t know all this, but any standards are better than no
standards.\
Does the business I have in mind alleviate a frustration experienced by
a large enough group of consumers to make it worth my while?\
Central demographic model : a most probable customer.\
\
== ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY\
\
The organizational development reflected in the Organizational Chart can
have a more profound impact on a small company than any other single
business development step.\
More companies organize around personalities rather than around
functions. (& the result is chaos)\
Make a chart of positions : COO, VP Marketing, VP Operations, VP
Finance, Sales manager, Advertising/Research manager, Production
manager, Service manager, Facilities manager, Accounts receivable
manager, Accounts payable manager. (clear tree of who reports to who)\
A position contract : a summary of the results to be achieved by each
position in the company, the work that position is accountable for, a
list of standards by which results are to be evaluated. Sign off on it.
Not a job description, it is a contract between the company, employee,
and a summary of the rules of the game. It provides each person with a
sense of commitment and accountability.\
\
Look at each position as a franchise prototype of its own.\
When one goes to work in a position, one goes to work ON a position,
implementing the business development process of innovation,
quantification, orchestration.\
\
Don\'t hire someone with experience. Not a master technician. A novice,
a beginner, an apprentice. Someone eager to learn how to do it right.
Willing to learn what you\'ve spent so much time and energy discovering.
Someone who is open to the possibility of learning skills not developed
yet, skills he/she wants to learn.\
\
If you don\'t obey the rules, honor them, extol them, why should you
expect anyone else to take your game seriously?\
\
\
== MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\
\
You may think your plan depends on highly skilled people. It doesn\'t.
You don\'t need such people. You can\'t afford them. They will become
the bane of your existence.\
What you need is a mangement system.\
The system will become your management strategy, and produces the
results you want.\
The system will become your solution to the problems of unpredictable
people, by orchestrating the process by which management decisions are
made, while eliminating the need for such decisions whenever possible.\
\
A management system is a system designed into your prototype to produce
a marketing result.\
The more automatic that system is, the more effective your franchise
prototype will be.\
Management development - the process through which you create your
management system, and teach up-and-upcoming managers to use it, isn\'t
a management tool - it\'s a marketing tool.\
Its purpose is not just to create an efficient prototype but an
effective one : one that finds and keeps customers, profitably, better
than any other.\
(HOTEL STORY HERE)\
\
\
== PEOPLE STRATEGY\
\
\"How do I get my people to do what I want?\"\
You can\'t get your people to do anything.\
If you want it done, create an environment where \"doing it\" is more
important to them than not doing it. Where \"doing it\" well becomes a
way of life.\
The work we do is a reflection of who we are. If we\'re sloppy at it,
it\'s because we\'re sloppy inside. If we\'re late, it\'s because we\'re
late inside. If we\'re bored, we\'re bored inside.\
The most menial work can be a piece of art when done by an artist.\
So the job here is not outside of ourselves, but inside of ourselves.\
Make sure they understand the idea behind the work they\'re being asked
to do. An idea more important than the work itself.\
Everyone who works here is expected to work towards being the best he
can possibly be at the tasks he\'s accountable for. When he can\'t do
that, he should act like he is. If unwilling to act, leave.\
A business is like a martial arts practice hall - a dojo - a place you
go to practice being the best you can be.\
A game to be played in which the rules symbolize the idea you, the
owner, have about the world.\
The degree to which they buy into your game doesn\'t depend on them but
on how well you communicate the game to them - at the outset of the
relationship - not after it\'s begun.\
Your People Strategy is the way you communicate your idea.\
\
1. Never try to make a game out of what you want your people to do. The
game has to come first, what your people do comes second. (?)\
2. Never create a game you\'re unwilling to play yourself.\
3. Make sure there are ways of winning the game without ending it.
(never actually end it, but give occasional victories)\
4. Change the game from time to time : the tactics, not the strategy.
(any game can become boring, no matter how extraordinary it was.
anticipate the end before anyone else does, and change it by executive
action)\
5. Remind people of the game, constantly. Once a week, have a meeting
about the game. Once a day, make some kind of issue about an exception
to the way the game has been played, and make certain everyone knows
about it.\
6. The game has to make sense.\
7. The game needs to be fun from time to time. (not all the time)\
8. If you can\'t think of a good game, steal one.\
\
The hiring process is the first and most essential medium for
communicating the Boss\' idea.\
HIRING:\
1. scripted presentation communicating the Boss\' idea in a group
meeting to all the applicants at once. describe the idea, history,
successful experience implementing the idea, attributes required of the
successful candidate for the position.\
2. meeting with each applicant individually to discuss reactions and
feelings about the idea, as well as his background and experience. ask
why they feel they\'re great for the role in implementing the idea.\
3. notify successful candidate by phone.\
4. notify unsuccessful applicants, thanking for their interest.\
5. first day of training:\
- reviewing boss\' idea\
- summarizing the system\
- take a tour of facilities, highlighting people at work, systems at
work, to demonstrate the interdependence of systems on people and people
on systems\
- answering employee\'s questions fully\
- give operations manual\
- review operations manual\
- completing employment papers\
\
Don\'t hire experienced managers, because they\'ll manage by standards
they learned somewhere else.\
You must take full accountability for what\'s going on in your business.
You must lead the company in the direction you intend it to go.\
You must set the standard.\
The Management System : all managers and future-managers are expected to
produce results.\
You don\'t need professional managers to manage to those standards :
just people who wish to learn how to manage them. People who are
personally committed to those standards as you are.\
\
You need people who want to play your game. Not people who believe they
have a better one.\
\
Hierarchy of systems: (where the \"it\" is the stated purpose of your
business.)\
1 : how we do it here\
2 : how we recruit, hire, and train people to do it here\
3 : how we manage it here\
4 : how we change it here\
\
\
== MARKETING STRATEGY:\
\
When it comes to marketing, what you want is unimportant. It\'s what
your customer wants that matters.\
What your customer wants is probably different that what he thinks he
wants.\
Make a promise the customer wants to hear, then deliver on that promise
better than anyone else on the block.\
The COO is the driver of all of this. The COO connects each part of the
business process. The COO maintains the integrity of the whole.\
\
\
== SYSTEMS STRATEGY:\
\
A system is a set of things, actions, ideas, and information that
interact with each other, and in so doing, alter other systems. (?)\
\
Information is the glue that holds your system strategy together. It
tells you when and why you need to change. :::

--------

"The only true voyage of discovery, the only fountain of Eternal Youth,
would be not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes, to behold
the universe through the eyes of another." - MARCEL PROUST\
\
Your brain's greatest skill is its ability to think about the minds of
others in order to understand them better.\
\
More time together did not make the couples any more accurate; it just
gave them the illusion that they were more accurate.\
\
Compared to the mental abilities of other species on this planet, our
sixth sense is what truly makes our brains superpowered. The problem is
that the confidence we have in this sense far outstrips our actual
ability, and the confidence we have in our judgment rarely gives us a
good sense of how accurate we actually are. The main goal of this book
is to reduce your illusion of insight into the minds of others, both by
trying to improve your understanding and by inducing a greater sense of
humility about what you know - and what you do not know - about others.\
\
Descartes was so certain about his introspective ability that he staked
his own, as well as God's, existence on it with his famous "I think,
therefore I am".\
\
People who imagined seeing an instance of blatant sexism thought they
would be outraged. When people actually saw this very same act, however,
they felt virtually no rage at all. Do people not know their own minds?\
\
You are consciously aware of your brain's finished products - conscious
attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and feelings - but are unaware of the
processes your brain went through to construct those final products, and
you are therefore unable to recognize its mistakes.\
\
In each of us there is another whom we do not know.\
\
People tended to select attractively enhanced images of themselves,
thinking they were more attractive than they actually were. This is why
most of the pictures taken of you seem to look so bad.\
\
When you don't know the actual facts about yourself, your consciousness
pieces together a compelling story, much in the same way it does when
you're trying to read the minds of other people to make sense of why
they act as they do.\
\
Shoppers were first shown four pairs of stockings and asked to pick the
best. In fact, the stockings were identical. The researchers found that
the ordering mattered: shoppers preferred whichever stocking was on the
far right (thereby evaluated last) four times more often than whichever
stocking was on the far left (thereby evaluated first).\
\
No psychologist asks people to explain the causes of their own thoughts
or behavior anymore unless they're interested in understanding
storytelling.\
\
If you see someone hunched over, you will assume that they are not
feeling very proud. Find yourself hunching over in the same way, even if
only because you're filling out a survey on a table with very short
legs, and you may report being less proud of yourself and your
accomplishments, too.\
\
An illusion that we know our own minds more deeply than we actually do
has one disturbing consequence: it can make your mind appear superior to
the minds of others.\
\
Naïve realism: the intuitive sense that we see the world out there as it
actually is, rather than as it appears from our own perspective.\
\
If the illusions you hold about your own brain lead you to believe that
you see the world as it actually is and you find that others see the
world differently, then they must be the ones who are biased, distorted,
uninformed, ignorant, unreasonable, or evil.\
\
The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to
be indifferent to them.\
\
Europeans since the time of the ancient Greeks viewed those living in
relatively primitive cultures as lacking a mind in one of two ways:
either lacking self-control and emotions, like an animal, or lacking
reason and intellect, like a child.\
\
It can be easy to forget that other people have minds with the same
general capacities and experiences as your own.\
\
Distance keeps your sixth sense disengaged.\
\
Your ability to understand the minds of others can be triggered by your
physical senses.\
\
Sit up straight and you'll feel more proud of your accomplishments.\
\
Furrowing your brow, as if you are thinking harder, can lead you to
actually think harder.\
\
Botox dulls your social senses right along with your wrinkles.\
\
Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is involved in making inferences about
the minds of others. MPFC is engaged more when you're thinking about
yourself, your close friends and family, and others who have beliefs
similar to your own. It is activated when you care enough about others
to care what they are thinking, and not when you are indifferent to
others.\
\
A universal tendency to assume that others' minds are less sophisticated
and more superficial than one's own.\
\
Ubuntu: "a person is a person through other persons." Your humanity
comes from the way you treat others, the idea goes, not the way you
behave in isolation.\
\
You can recognize intrinsic motivations more easily in yourself than in
others.\
\
Treat workers with respect, encourage them to think independently, allow
them to make decisions, and make them feel connected to an important
effort.\
\
I stopped staring blankly and instead looked one of the boys directly in
the eyes, smiled, and waved. It was like I flipped a switch in him. I
suddenly wasn't just a foreigner; I was a human being. He flew into a
wide-eyed smile and a big wave.\
\
Engage the minds of others more routinely instead of treating nearby
neighbors as mindless objects.\
\
Attributing a mind to a nonhuman agent is the inverse process of failing
to attribute a mind to another person.\
\
Too fast or too slow and the robot in these experiments was recognized
as a mindless machine, but at just the right speed, closer to human
speed, the robot seemed more mindful. It started to look like it might
be thinking or planning or feeling something.\
\
The concept of a mind can explain the behavior of almost anything.\
\
Religious beliefs are intuitively compelling because minds are intuitive
explanations for the behavior of almost anything.\
\
Urban children are more likely to anthropomorphize animals such as cows
and pigs and deer than are rural children. Why? Because rural children
are likely to have considerably more knowledge about these animals,
knowledge acquired through direct experience.\
\
A man on one side of a river shouts to a man standing on the other side,
"Hey, how do I get to the other side of the river?" The other man
responds, "You are on the other side of the river."\
\
People are insanely self-conscious. People act like they're always being
watched. Even their house is a performance.\
\
All of the world may indeed be a stage, and it's easy to feel that we're
at the center of it.\
\
The social spotlight does not shine on us nearly as brightly as we
think.\
\
Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't
matter and those who matter don't mind.\
\
Becoming aware of your own perspective liberates you from it.\
\
"The media" are consistently accused of being biased but never found to
favor those making the accusations.\
\
People tend to exaggerate the extent to which others think, believe, and
feel as they do.\
\
Knowledge is a curse because once you have it, you can't imagine what
it's like not to possess it.\
\
Ever tried to get driving directions from a local?\
\
Tappers estimated that listeners would identify the song correctly, on
average, 50 percent of the time. In fact, listeners guessed correctly
only 2.5 percent of the time.\
\
The lens problem affects anyone who has unique knowledge of anything:
the boss who understands a proposal inside out and is trying to convey
the ideas to new clients, the inventor who knows precisely why her
invention is so important speaking to impatient venture capitalists, or
the coworker who is "just teasing" a new hire who knows nothing of the
teaser's friendly intentions. The expert's problem is assuming that
what's so clear in his or her own mind is more obvious to others.\
\
Consider how they would be judged by someone looking at their
photograph.\
\
Knowing how you are seen through the eyes of others requires looking at
yourself though the same lens that others do.\
\
Ambiguous mediums like email and texting and Twitter are such fertile
ground for misunderstanding.\
\
Those actually receiving the messages, however, could understand the
speaker's intention only when the speaker was on the phone. They could
hear the sarcasm dripping from their voice regardless of whether they
were actually using their voice or typing with their fingers. Those
receiving the message, of course, could hear the sarcasm only through
the speaker's voice and heard nothing from the speaker's fingers.\
\
Believers might be even more egocentric when reasoning about God's
beliefs than when reasoning about other people's beliefs.\
\
If God is a moral compass, then the compass seems prone to pointing
believers in whatever direction they are already facing.\
\
Politicians talk about what "the people" want: the speaker's own
beliefs.\
\
You can't judge another person until you've walked a mile in their
shoes. You hear it so often because the advice is so routinely ignored -
by the rich who judge the poor as lazy and incompetent, the sober who
judge the addicted to be weak and immoral, and the happy who can't
understand why the depressed don't just "snap out of it."\
\
Learn that someone is a member of a different group than you, and you
will drop egocentrism and pick up a stereotype to reason about that
person's mind instead.\
\
Liberals favor a more equitable distribution than do conservatives, but
by how much? The difference between Democratic and Republican
presidential voters was only 3.5 percent. Expecting a 40 percent gap
between poor and rich when the actual gap was only 3 percent.\
\
How your brain thinks of groups of anything: Instead of remembering
exact details, you extract the "gist" of the information. The "gist" of
a group is not its individual members but, rather, its average.\
\
Women tended to think men would be more sexist than they actually were,
exaggerating the differences between men and women.\
\
Where our stereotypes go wrong: getting too little information, defining
groups by their differences, and being unable to observe the true causes
of group differences directly.\
\
Each of us views only a small slice of the world's people, hears only
haphazard bits of highly selected evidence from news outlets or other
sources, and talks to only a narrow group of generally like-minded
friends.\
\
Stereotypes about majority groups also look to be more accurate than
stereotypes about minority groups, simply because larger groups provide
more observational evidence than smaller groups.\
\
When you go on a trip, much of your experience involves doing the same
thing for long stretches of time - flying, driving, sleeping, standing,
waiting, walking - but the story you tell your friends afterward is all
about the different things you experienced.\
\
You define yourself by the attributes that make you different.\
\
A man who claims to be searching for himself is looking for a sense of
distinction.\
\
Consider the common stereotype that women are more emotional than men:
Men and women watching the same emotionally evocative scenes show the
same emotional reactions, on average, of the same intensity. Where men
and women differ is in the outward expressions of their emotions, with
women being more expressive than men. But when people watch these men
and women, they infer that women are feeling more emotion than men
because they are showing more emotion than men.\
\
There are real differences in what men and women want but even larger
similarities.\
\
Those who write about gender are more attentive to differences than to
similarities.\
\
The differences among men and women are far larger than the differences
between men and women.\
\
Consider politics: people on opposing sides of each issue consistently
assume that the other side is more extreme than it actually is. Real
partisanship increases partly because of imagined partisanship on the
other side. Israel and Egypt were disputing ownership of the Sinai
Peninsula in 1976. Instead of fighting a zero-sum battle, the two sides
came together and figured out each other's actual interests. Israel
wanted security, and Egypt wanted sovereignty. The Israelis didn't want
the Sinai Peninsula; they just didn't want to be attacked from it. The
solution reached at Camp David was to give the land back to Egypt but to
create a demilitarized band along the border. Israel got its safety, and
Egypt got its land.\
\
When groups are defined by their differences, people think they have
less in common with people of other races or faiths or genders than they
actually do.\
\
Ignoring real group differences is every bit as mistaken as exaggerating
them.\
\
The elderly can behave differently than the young, blacks differently
than whites, and women differently than men because of stereotypes about
these groups rather than because of any inherent differences.\
\
The questioner asked difficult questions and, therefore, looked bright.
The contestant answered incorrectly and, therefore, looked dim. This is
the correspondence bias, inferring a mind that corresponds with observed
actions.\
\
Common sense infers that the players are of unequal intellect rather
than on an unequal playing field.\
\
Those living in collectivist cultures and those generally more concerned
with social norms and interpersonal harmony (such as in Southeast Asia)
are, broadly speaking, more likely to recognize when people's actions
reflect the dictates of their roles and environments rather than their
corresponding states of mind, compared to people in cultures that place
an emphasis on individual freedom and choice.\
\
Most people trust what others tell them even when they might be lying.\
\
The difficulty of disbelieving behavior that we naturally take at face
value.\
\
Misunderstanding the power of context can lead us to design ineffective
solutions to important problems. If our intuitions tell us that people
do what they want, then one path to changing their behavior is obvious:
you need to make people want the right things.\
\
Hurricane Katrina: "We've got to figure out some way to convince people
that whenever warnings go out, it's for their own good." The main
problem in Brown's mind was that people didn't want to leave, and so the
solution is to persuade people more effectively the next time. This
solution may create a great warning system that leaves just as many
people stranded the next time. Many who stayed wanted desperately to
leave but couldn't. They didn't need convincing, they needed a bus. You
can see the offspring of this error in many well-meaning interventions.
The poor making unwise financial choices? Roll out a financial literacy
program to make their minds smarter.\
\
Much more effective for changing behavior is targeting the broader
context rather than individual minds, making it easier for people to do
the things they already want to do. To keep people from littering, add
additional trash cans, and then to pick up existing trash that otherwise
makes it look like everyone else is littering.\
\
Paying students and teachers for improved performance was completely
ineffective.\
\
Assuming that a person's mind corresponds directly to his or her actions
misses the importance of context in shaping behavior.\
\
As the number of bystanders increases, the likelihood that any one of
them will help you actually decreases. The ideal number might be two:
one to help you and the other to call an ambulance.\
\
The tools at our intuitive disposal are simplifying heuristics that give
imperfect insight into the minds of others. The mistakes they lead to
create predictable errors that keep us from perfect understanding.\
\
Provide simple shortcuts for understanding the minds of others, but they
come at the cost of oversimplifying them.\
\
After I mention that I'm working on a book about mind reading, my
conversational partner assumes I'm writing about either body language
(learning to read facial cues or physical gestures) or perspective
taking (learning to imagine yourself in another person's situation).
Which approach does the scientific evidence support? Neither.\
\
To predict how the storyteller was feeling at each moment, those who
could only see the storyteller were significantly less accurate than
those who could only hear the storyteller. Emotions were carried
primarily on the speaker's voice.\
\
"Microexpressions," very brief flashes of emotion lasting less than
one-fifth of a second and shown either on the entire face or in just a
small part of it: The scientific credibility of claims about
microexpressions is currently weak, at best.\
\
Most of us are better liars than we think we are.\
\
Perspective taking consistently decreased accuracy. Overthinking
someone's emotional expression or inner intentions when there is little
else to go on might introduce more error than insight.\
\
Perspective taking exaggerated the perceived differences between the
groups, thereby increasing distrust and enhancing selfishness.\
\
What's the best way to get someone a gift? The science is clear. You
don't try to adopt another person's perspective and guess better.
Instead, you adopt a different approach. You have to actually get the
other person's perspective, and perhaps the only way to do that is to
ask what they want, or listen carefully while they drop hints, and then
give it to them. That turns out to be widely applicable wisdom.\
\
Nearly everything you know is secondhand: things you know only because
someone told you.\
\
The best predictor of empathic accuracy appears to be verbal
intelligence. Knowing others' minds requires asking and listening, not
just reading and guessing.\
\
Getting your partner's perspective by asking them directly works much
better than taking your partner's perspective by using your
imagination.\
\
Getting people to tell you their minds is the best overall solution for
understanding them.\
\
The main barrier to getting perspective is that others won't tell you
what you'd like to know. They lie, mislead, misdirect, avoid, or simply
refuse to divulge the truth. The vast majority of these lies are told by
a small number of chronic liars. Keep your cynicism in check. Many
people will tell you the truth if you ask a direct question in a context
where they feel at liberty to give an honest answer and you are open to
hearing.\
\
The main reason people lie is to avoid being punished.\
\
Instead of pressuring suspects until they crack from intimidation, fear,
and pain, the new and more effective interrogation approach is one that
establishes rapport and reduces fears of punishment. People were more
willing to admit to having done something immoral when confronted a few
minutes after the event - when their fear had subsided a bit - than when
questioned immediately after the incident.\
\
It makes no more sense for a pollster to ask you why you're voting for
someone than it does for a doctor to ask you why you're feeling sick.
And so pollsters instead ask about what people think.\
\
People know their feelings right now more accurately than they can
project what they'll be feeling months from now. Generally focus
questions on the present rather than the future. Getting perspective
fails if your direct questions turn speculative.\
\
If you have to reiterate someone else's point to their satisfaction,
then you'll find out if you've understood.\
\
Understanding other people requires getting their perspective and then
verifying that you've understood it correctly.\
\
Technique for creating fast friends is to have two strangers disclose
private thoughts or memories to each other.\
\
The secret to understanding each other better seems to come not through
an increased ability to read body language or improved perspective
taking but, rather, through the hard relational work of putting people
in a position where they can tell you their minds openly and honestly.

A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy - by William Irvine

How strongly I recommend it: **10**/10\
**(See [my list of 200+ books](/book), for more.)**

**Go to the [Amazon

and reviews.

Almost too personal for me to give an objective review, because I found
when reading it that the quirky philosophy I\'ve been living my life by
since 17 matches up exactly with a 2000-year-old philosophy called
Stoicism. Mine was self-developed haphazardly, so it was fascinating to
read the refined developed original. Really resonated.

my notes
--------

If you lack a grand goal in living, you lack a coherent philosophy of
life.\
When you are on your deathbed, you will look back and realize that you
wasted your one chance at living.\
Instead of spending your life pursuing something genuinely valuable, you
squandered it because you allowed yourself to be distracted.\
\
Whatever philosophy of life you adopt, you will probably have a better
life than if you tried to live without a coherent philosophy of life.\
\
Of the things in life you might pursue, which is the thing you believe
to be most valuable?\
\
Find delight in your own resources, and desire no joys greater than your
inner joys.\
\
You are unlikely to have a good and meaningful life unless you can
overcome your insatiability.\
\
Why is self-discipline worth possessing? Because those who possess it
have the ability to determine what they do with their life. Those who
lack self-discipline will have the path they take through life
determined by someone or something else.\
\
Philosophical thinking took a giant leap forward in the sixth century
BC:\
Pythagoras (570-500 BC) in Italy\
Thales (636-546 BC), Anaximander (641-547 BC), and Heracleitus (535-475
BC) in Greece\
Confucius (551-479 BC) in China\
Buddha (563-483 BC) in India\
\
Philosophers provided their pupils with a philosophy of life: They
taught them what things in life were worth pursuing and how best to
pursue them.\
\
The Cynics thought people should enjoy the good things life has to
offer, including friendship and wealth, but only if they did not cling
to these good things. They thought we should periodically interrupt our
enjoyment of what life has to offer to spend time contemplating the loss
of whatever it is we are enjoying.\
\
But if they avoided the \"good things,\" as the Cynics did, they thereby
demonstrated that the things in question really were good - were things
that, if they did not hide them from themselves, they would crave.\
\
The Stoics enjoyed whatever \"good things\" happened to be available,
but even as they did so, they prepared themselves to give up the things
in question.\
\
The Stoics were not stoical!\
\
Religions, after telling adherents what they must do to be morally
upstanding and get into heaven, leave it to them to determine what
things in life are and aren\'t worth pursuing. These religions see
nothing wrong with an adherent working hard so he can afford a huge
mansion and an expensive sports car. Adherents of the various religions,
despite the differences in their religious beliefs, end up with the same
impromptu philosophy of life, namely, a form of enlightened hedonism.\
\
Pay attention to your enemies, for they are the first to discover your
mistakes.\
\
Hunger is the best appetizer, because if you wait until you\'re hungry
or thirsty before you eat or drink, you\'ll eat simple food with greater
pleasure than others do of the costliest of foods.\
\
Parents sent their children to schools of philosophy not just so they
could learn how to live well but so they could sharpen their skills of
persuasion. By teaching their students logic, the Stoics were helping
them develop these skills: Students who knew logic could detect the
fallacies committed by others and thereby prevail over them in
arguments.\
\
We differ from other animals in one important respect: We have the
ability to reason. We were designed to be reasonable.\
\
A Stoic sage is free from vanity. He is indifferent to good or evil
report. He never feels grief, since grief is an irrational contraction
of the soul.\
\
The sage is a target to aim at, even though you fail to hit it. The sage
is to Stoicism as Buddha is to Buddhism. Most Buddhists can never hope
to become as enlightened as Buddha, but nevertheless, reflecting on
Buddha\'s perfection can help them gain a degree of enlightenment.\
\
Tranquility is a psychological state in which we experience few negative
emotions, such as anxiety, grief, and fear, but an abundance of positive
emotions, especially joy.\
\
Seneca explains how best to pursue tranquility. Use your reasoning
ability to drive away all that excites or affrights you. If you can do
this, there will ensue unbroken tranquility and enduring freedom.\
\
A Stoic school should be like a physician\'s consulting room: patients
should leave feeling bad rather than feeling good - the idea being that
any treatment likely to cure a patient is also likely to cause him
discomfort.\
\
You rob present ills of their power if you expect them.\
Misfortune weighs most heavily on those who expect nothing but good
fortune.\
\
We\'re unhappy because we\'re insatiable. After working hard to get what
we want, we lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than
feeling satisfied, we feel a bit bored, and in response to this boredom,
we go on to form new, even grander desires.\
\
The easiest way to gain happiness is to want the things you already
have.\
\
Spend time imagining that you have lost the things you value - that your
wife has left you, your car was stolen, you lost your job. Doing this
will make you value your wife, your car, and your job more than you
otherwise would.\
\
While kissing your child, silently reflect on the possibility that she
will die tomorrow.\
\
As we go about our day, periodically pause to reflect on the fact that
you will not live forever and therefore this day could be your last.\
\
Think about how you would feel if you lost your material possessions,
including your house, car, clothing, pets, and bank balance. How you
would feel if you lost your abilities, including your ability to speak,
hear, walk, breathe, and swallow; and how you would feel if you lost
your freedom.\
\
You are living the dream you once had for yourself. Married to the
person you once dreamed of marrying, have the children and job you once
dreamed of having, and own the car you once dreamed of buying.\
\
You are living in what to your ancestors would have been a dream world.
You take for granted things that your ancestors had to live without.\
\
An optimist sees his glass as being half full. For a Stoic, this degree
of optimism would only be a starting point. After expressing his
appreciation that his glass is half full rather than being completely
empty, he will go on to express his delight in even having a glass: It
could, after all, have been broken or stolen. And if he is atop his
Stoic game, he might go on to comment about what an astonishing thing
glass vessels are: They are cheap and fairly durable, impart no taste to
what we put in them, and-miracle of miracles!-allow us to see what they
contain.\
\
There is a difference between contemplating something bad happening and
worrying about it. Contemplation is an intellectual exercise. Conduct
such exercises without affecting your emotions.\
\
One father periodically contemplates the loss of his child and therefore
does not take her for granted; to the contrary, he appreciates her very
much.\
Another father assumes that his child will always be there for him and
therefore takes her for granted.\
\
Do not over-love the things you enjoy. Be the user, but not the slave,
of the gifts of fortune.\
\
There will be a last time you hear the sound of snow falling, watch the
moon rise, smell popcorn, feel the warmth of a child falling asleep in
your arms. Every time you do something could be the last time you do it,
and this recognition can invest the things you do with a significance
and intensity that would otherwise be absent.\
\
It is impossible that happiness, and yearning for what is not present,
should ever be united.\
\
Want only those things that are easy to obtain. Want only those things
you can be certain of obtaining.\
\
Gain contentment by changing ourselves - by changing our desires.\
\
If you refuse to enter contests that you are capable of losing, you will
never lose a contest.\
\
The key to having a good life is to value things that are genuinely
valuable and be indifferent to things that lack value.\
\
Any time and energy spent on events you can\'t control will have no
effect on the outcome of events and will therefore be wasted time and
energy.\
\
Set internal rather than external goals.\
\
Internalize your goals. Make a goal not to change the world, but to do
your best to bring about certain changes. Even if your efforts prove to
be ineffectual, you can rest easy knowing you accomplished your goal:
You did what you could do.\
\
Be fatalistic with respect to the past and present. Refuse to compare
your situation with alternative, preferable situations in which you
might have found or might now find yourself.\
\
Be attentive to all the advantages that adorn life.\
\
Besides contemplating bad things happening, sometimes live as if they
had happened. Instead of merely thinking about what it would be like to
lose your wealth, periodically practice poverty: Content yourself with
cheap fare and rough dress.\
\
Examine the things you thought you needed so you can determine which of
them you can in fact live without.\
\
If you coddle yourself and allow yourself to be corrupted by pleasure,
nothing will seem bearable. Not because things are hard but because you
are soft. Ensure you never get too comfortable.\
\
Periodically experience discomfort that you could have avoided.
Underdress for cold weather or go shoeless. Become thirsty or hungry,
even though water and food are at hand.\
\
Do not inflict these discomforts to punish yourself; rather, do it to
increase your enjoyment of life.\
\
Harden yourself against misfortunes that might befall you in the future.
If all you know is comfort, you might be traumatized when you are forced
to experience pain or discomfort, as you someday almost surely will.\
\
If you periodically experience minor discomforts, you will grow
confident that you can withstand major discomforts as well. So you
won\'t fear experiencing such discomforts at some future time. By
experiencing minor discomforts, you train yourself to be courageous.\
\
You\'ll better appreciate whatever comfort you experience.\
\
If you periodically embrace discomfort, you\'re more likely to be
comfortable than someone who tries to avoid all discomfort. You\'ll have
a much wider comfort zone than others and will therefore feel
comfortable under circumstances that would cause others distress.\
\
Sometimes abstain from harmless pleasures. Pass up an opportunity to
drink wine - not because you fear becoming an alcoholic but so you can
learn self-control.\
\
Willpower is like muscle power: the more you exercise your will, the
stronger it gets.\
\
By practicing self-denial techniques over a long period, you can
transform yourself into someone remarkable for your courage and
self-control. You will be able to do things that others dread doing, and
refrain from doing things that others cannot resist doing. You will be
thoroughly in control of yourself. This self-control makes it far more
likely that you will attain the goals of your philosophy of life, and
this in turn dramatically increases your chances of living a good life.\
\
Consciously abstaining from pleasure can itself be pleasant.\
You will be pleased and will praise yourself.\
\
Periodically meditate on the events of daily living, how you responded
to these events, and how, in accordance with Stoic principles, you
should have responded to them.\
\
Shrug off all insults and slights. Also shrug off any praise.\
\
To know how many are jealous of you, count your admirers.\
\
Stop blaming, censuring, and praising others. Stop boasting about
ourselves and how much we know. Blame yourself, not external
circumstances, when your desires are thwarted.\
\
Perform with resoluteness the duties we humans were created to perform.
Nothing else should distract you. When you wake, rather than lying in
bed, you must get up to do the proper work of man, the work you were
created to perform.\
\
If you do the things you were made for, you will enjoy man\'s true
delight.\
\
You cannot simply avoid dealing with annoying people, even though doing
so would make your life easier. Nor can you capitulate to these annoying
people to avoid discord. Instead, you should confront them and work for
the common welfare. Show true love to the people with whom destiny has
surrounded you.\
\
Doing your social duty will give you the best chance at having a good
life. This is the reward for doing one\'s duty: a good life.\
\
Form a certain character and pattern for yourself when you are alone.
Then, when you associate with other people, remain true to who you are.\
\
Be selective about which social functions you attend.\
\
You must associate with annoying, misguided, or malicious people in
order to work for common interests. But be selective about whom you
befriend. Avoid befriending people whose values have been corrupted, so
their values won\'t contaminate yours. Instead seek people who share our
values and in particular, people who are doing a better job than we are
of living in accordance with good values. While enjoying the
companionship of these individuals, work hard to learn what you can from
them.\
\
Spend time with an \"unclean\" person, and you will become unclean as
well.\
\
When irritated by someone\'s shortcomings, pause to reflect on your own
shortcomings. Doing this will help you become more empathetic to this
individual\'s faults and therefore become more tolerant of him.\
\
Social fatalism: When dealing with others, assume they are fated to
behave in a certain way. It is therefore pointless to wish they could be
any other way.\
\
The biggest risk in dealing with annoying people is that they will make
you hate them, a hatred that is injurious to you. Therefore, you need to
work to make sure men do not succeed in destroying your charitable
feelings toward them.\
\
The Stoics were big advocates of marriage. A wise man will marry, and
having married, he and his wife will work hard to keep each other happy.
In a good marriage, two people will join in a loving union and will try
to outdo each other in the care they show for each other.\
\
Consider the source of an insult. If you respect the source and value
his opinions, then his critical remarks shouldn\'t upset you.\
\
If you don\'t respect the source of an insult, rather than feeling hurt
by his insults, you should feel relieved.\
\
Take the insults of your fellow humans to be like the barking of a dog.
When a dog barks, you might make a mental note that the dog appears to
dislike you, but you would be a fool to become upset by this fact.\
\
What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about
these things.\
\
Refusing to respond to an insult is one of the most effective
responses.\
\
Protecting disadvantaged individuals from insults will tend to make them
hypersensitive to insults.\
\
Grieving the death of his brother, Seneca writes, \"Nature requires from
us some sorrow, while more than this is the result of vanity.\"\
\
Retrospective negative visualization: imagine never having had something
that you have lost. By engaging in retrospective negative visualization,
you can replace your feelings of regret at having lost something with
feelings of thanks for once having had it.\
\
Reason is our best weapon against grief, because unless reason puts an
end to our tears, fortune will not do so.\
\
Responding to the grief of friends by also grieving is as foolish as
helping someone who has been poisoned by also taking poison.\
\
We are bad men living among bad men, and only one thing can calm us: we
must agree to go easy on one another.\
\
People mistakenly pursue fame. Some want to be known around the world.
Some seek regional fame or popularity within their social circle or
recognition in their chosen profession. Almost everyone seeks the
admiration of friends and neighbors.\
\
The price of fame is so high that it far outweighs any benefits.\
\
Don\'t seek social status, since if you make it your goal to please
others, you will no longer be free to please yourself. You will have
enslaved yourself.\
\
Dealing with other people, be indifferent to what they think of us. Be
consistent in your indifference. Be as dismissive of approval as you are
of disapproval.\
\
Cato consciously did things to trigger the disdain of other people
simply so he could practice ignoring their disdain.\
\
Not needing wealth is more valuable than wealth itself.\
\
If you are exposed to a luxurious lifestyle, you might lose your ability
to take delight in simple things.\
\
Being exposed to luxurious living, people become hard to please. But
rather than mourning the loss of their ability to enjoy simple things,
they take pride in their newly gained inability to enjoy anything but
\"the best.\"\
\
People who achieve luxurious lifestyles are rarely satisfied:
Experiencing luxury only whets their appetite for even more luxury.\
\
Dress to protect our bodies, not to impress other people. Likewise, our
housing should be functional.\
\
Imagine what it would be like to be old. The abilities you once took for
granted will have departed. You used to run for miles; now you get
winded walking down the hallway. You used to handle the finances of a
corporation; now you can\'t even balance your checkbook.\
\
The most delightful time of life is when it is on the downward slope,
but has not yet reached the abrupt decline.\
\
In your youth, because you assumed that you would live forever, you take
your days for granted and as a result wasted many of them. In old age,
however, waking up each morning can be a cause for celebration.\
\
Having a coherent philosophy of life can make you more accepting of
death. With a coherent philosophy of life you\'ll know what in life is
worth attaining, and because you spent time trying to attain the thing
in life you believe to be worth attaining, you have probably attained
it, to the extent that it was possible for you to do so. Consequently,
when it comes time for you to die, you will not feel cheated.\
\
Those who have lived without a coherent philosophy of life, though, will
desperately want to delay death. Because their improvised philosophy of
life has convinced them that what is worth having in life is more of
everything, and they cannot get more of everything if they die.\
\
Someone who thinks he will live forever is far more likely to waste his
days than someone who fully understands that his days are numbered.\
\
We would also be better off\...\
if, instead of working hard to become wealthy, we trained ourselves to
be satisfied with what we have\
if, instead of seeking fame, we overcame our craving for the admiration
of others\
if, instead of spending time scheming to harm someone we envy, we spent
that time overcoming our feelings of envy\
if, instead of knocking ourselves out trying to become popular, we
worked to maintain and improve our relationships with those we knew to
be true friends.\
\
Learn how to enjoy things without feeling entitled to them and without
clinging to them.\
\
Thoreau was interested in developing a philosophy of life. Always the
practical question: How best can I live my daily life?\
\
When people experience personal catastrophes, it is perfectly natural to
experience grief. After this bout of reflexive grief, though, a Stoic
will try to dispel whatever grief remains in him by trying to reason it
out of existence. He will invoke the kinds of arguments Seneca used in
his consolations: \"Is this what the person who died would want me to
do? Of course not! She would want me to be happy! The best way to honor
her memory is to leave off grieving and get on with life.\"\
\
Because grief is a negative emotion, the Stoics opposed it. At the same
time, they realized that because we are mere mortals, some grief is
inevitable in the course of a lifetime, as are some fear, some anxiety,
some anger, some hatred, some humiliation, and some envy. The goal of
the Stoics was therefore not to eliminate grief but to minimize it.\
\
The first step in transforming a society into one in which people live a
good life is to teach people how to make their happiness depend as
little as possible on their external circumstances.\
The second step in transforming a society is to change people\'s
external circumstances.\
\
If we fail to transform ourselves, then no matter how much we transform
the society in which we live, we are unlikely to have a good life.\
\
If you had gone to Epictetus and said, \"I want to live a good life.
What should I do?\" he would have had an answer for you: \"Live in
accordance with nature.\" He would then have told you, in great detail,
how to do this.\
\
If you went to a 20-century analytic philosopher and asked the same
question, he probably would have responded not by answering the question
you asked but by analyzing the question itself: \"The answer to your
question depends on what you mean by \"a good life,\" which in turn
depends on what you mean by \"good\" and \"a life.\" He might then walk
you through all the things you could conceivably mean in asking how to
live a good life and explain why each of these meanings is logically
muddled.\
\
His conclusion: It makes no sense to ask how to live a good life. When
this philosopher had finished speaking, you might be impressed with his
flair for philosophical analysis, but you might also conclude, with good
reason, that he himself lacked a coherent philosophy of life.\
\
Philosophies of life have two components: They tell us what things in
life are and aren\'t worth pursuing, and they tell us how to gain the
things that are worth having.\
\
If you lack a grand goal in living, you lack a coherent philosophy of
life.\
\
We gained the ability to walk because our ancestors who had this ability
were more likely to survive and reproduce than those who didn\'t, and
yet some people use this ability to climb Mount Everest, an activity
that distinctly reduces their chances of surviving.\
\
Just as we can \"misuse\" our ability to hear or walk-use these
abilities, that is, in a way that has nothing to do with the survival
and reproduction of our species-we can misuse our ability to reason.\
In particular, we can use it to circumvent the behavioral tendencies
that have been programmed into us by evolution.\
\
We can use our reasoning ability to conclude that many of the things
that our evolutionary programming encourages us to seek, such as social
status and more of anything we already have, may be valuable if our goal
is simply to survive and reproduce, but aren\'t at all valuable if our
goal is instead to experience tranquility while we are alive.\
\
It\'s now possible to survive despite having low social status; even if
others despise us, the law prevents them from taking our food from us or
driving us from our home. Furthermore, low social status is no longer an
impediment to reproduction; indeed, in many parts of the world, men and
women with low social status have higher rates of reproduction than men
and women with high social status. If our goal is not merely to survive
and reproduce but to enjoy a tranquil existence, the pain associated
with a loss of social status isn\'t just useless, it is
counterproductive.\
\
Consider our insatiability: As we have seen, our evolutionary ancestors
benefited from wanting more of everything, which is why we today have
this tendency. But our insatiability, if we do not take steps to bridle
it, will disrupt our tranquility; instead of enjoying what we already
have, we will spend our life working hard to gain things we don\'t have,
in the sadly mistaken belief that once we have them, we will enjoy them
and search no further. What we must do, again, is misuse our intellect.
Instead of using it to devise clever strategies to get more of
everything, we must use it to overcome our tendency toward
insatiability.\
\
Stoicism is a cure for a disease. The disease in question is the
anxiety, grief, fear, and various other negative emotions that plague
humans and prevent them from experiencing a joyful existence.\
\
Engage in negative visualization each night at bedtime.\
\
After mastering negative visualization, a novice Stoic should move on to
become proficient in applying the trichotomy of control.\
\
Do your best to accept the past, whatever it might have been, and to
embrace the present, whatever it might be.\
\
Refuse to spend time engaging in \"if only\" thoughts about the past and
present.\
\
Whenever you undertake an activity in which public failure is a
possibility, you are likely to experience butterflies in your stomach.
Since becoming a stoic, I have become a collector of insults. I have
also become a collector of butterflies.\
\
A calm life is actually disquieting because we are unaware of whether we
would remain strong in the case of a tempest.\
\
The biggest mistake, the one made by a huge number of people, is to have
no philosophy of life at all. These people feel their way through life
by following the promptings of their evolutionary programming, by
assiduously seeking out what feels good and avoiding what feels bad. By
doing this, they might have a comfortable life or even a life filled
with pleasure. The question remains, however, whether they could have a
better life by turning their back on their evolutionary programming and
instead devoting time and energy to acquiring a philosophy of life.\

my notes
--------

How much of what you do is for now, and how much is to please the future
you?\
\
We do \"good\" things in the charitable service of the people we will
soon become. We treat our future selves as though they were our
children, constructing tomorrows that we hope will make them happy.\
\
The human being is the only animal that thinks about the future.\
\
The greatest achievement of the human brain is its ability to imagine
objects and episodes that do not exist in the realm of the real, and it
is this ability that allows us to think about the future. The human
brain is an \"anticipation machine\" and \"making future\" is the most
important thing it does.\
\
Volunteers imagined themselves requesting a date with a person on whom
they had a major crush, and those who had had the most elaborate and
delicious fantasies about approaching their heartthrob were \*least\*
likely to do so over the next few months.\
\
When people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the
likelihood that it will occur. Because we get more practice imagining
good events than bad events, we overestimate the likelihood that good
events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically
optimistic about our futures.\
\
Although citizens of other nations are not as optimistic as Americans,
they also tend to imagine that their futures will be brighter than those
of their peers.\
\
Fear, worry, and anxiety have useful roles to play in our lives. We
motivate by dramatizing the unpleasant consequences of misbehaviors by
imagining the unpleasant tomorrows.\
\
The most important reason why our brains insist on simulating the future
is that our brains want to control the experiences we are about to
have.\
\
If we lose our ability to control things, we become unhappy, helpless,
hopeless, and depressed.\
\
People often act as though they can control the uncontrollable. People
bet more money on games of chance when their opponents seem incompetent
than competent - as though they believed they could control the random
drawing of cards from a deck and thus take advantage of a weak opponent.
People feel more certain that they will win a lottery if they can
control the number on their ticket, and they feel more confident that
they will win a dice toss if they can throw the dice themselves. People
will wager more money on dice that have not yet been tossed than on dice
that have already been tossed but whose outcome is not yet known, and
they will bet more if they, rather than someone else, are allowed to
decide which number will count as a win. All of these are absolutely
absurd if they believed they had no control over an uncontrollable
event.\
\
Subjectivity : the fact that experience is unobservable to everyone but
the person having it.\
\
Remembering yellow: 73% of people not-describing a remembered color
remembered it. Only 33% of those that described it in-between remembered
it. Describing the color impaired rather than improved performance.
Verbal descriptions overwrote their memories.\
\
No one knows what happiness really is. Therefore we should never say we
are happy until we are dead because otherwise, if the real thing ever
does come along, we will have used up the word and won\'t have any way
to tell the newspapers about it.\
\
Volunteers showed quiz-show questions, and asked to estimate the
likelihood that they could answer them correctly. Volunteers who saw
only the questions thought they were difficult. Volunteers who saw both
the question and the answer believed they could have answered the
questions easily had they never seen the answers at all.\
\
\^ Once we have an experience, we cannot simply set it aside and see the
world as we would have seen it had the experience never happened. The
jury cannot disregard the prosecutor\'s snide remarks.\
\
To say an experience that once brought me pleasure no longer does? A man
given a drink of water in the desert may rate his happiness at that
moment as an 8/8. A year later, that same drink might make him feel no
better than a 2/8. Are we to believe he was wrong about how happy he was
in the desert, or that a sip of water can be a source of ecstasy or a
source of moisture depending on one\'s experiential background?\
\
The moment we encounter an object, our brains instantly analyze just a
few of its key features and then use the presence or absence of these
features to make one very fast simple decision: \"Is this object an
important thing to which I ought to respond right now?\"\
\
Numbfeel : It is possible - at least for some of the people some of the
time - to be happy, sad, bored, or curious, and not know it.\
\
Our brain offers us an interpretation of the way things are. Because
those interpretations are usually so good, we do not realize that we are
seeing an interpretation. Instead, we feel as though we are sitting
comfortably inside our heads, looking out though the clear glass
windshield of our eyes, watching the world as it really is. We forget
that our brains are talented forgers, weaving a tapestry of memory and
perception whose detail is so compelling that its inauthenticity is
rarely detected. The mistake we make when we unthinkingly accept the
validity of our memories and perceptions is the same mistake we make
when we imagine our futures.\
\
Seeing in time is like seeing in space. When things are far away (in
space) they are vague and lacking in detail. We do not mistakenly
conclude that the far-away thing is vague and lacking in detail. But
when we remember or imagine a distant (in time) event, our brains seem
to overlook the fact that details vanish, and we conclude that the
distant events are as vague as we are imagining and remembering them.
For example, have you ever wondered why you often make commitments that
you deeply regret when the moment to fulfill them arrives? When we said
yes, we were thinking in terms of why instead of how, in terms of causes
of consequences instead of execution, and we failed to consider the fact
that the detail-free event we were imagining would not be the
detail-laden event we would actually experience. Doing something next
month is \"an act of love\", whereas doing it right now is \"an act of
lunch\".\
\
When volunteers are asked to \"imagine a good day\", they imagine a
greater variety of events if the good day is tomorrow than if the good
day is a year later. Tomorrow is imagined in considerable detail, as mix
of good stuff and unpleasant stuff. A good day a year later is imagined
as a smooth purée of happy episodes. When asked, they think the mental
images of the near and far futures are equally realistic.\
\
Curiosity : people given boring quiz asked (beforehand) if they\'d
prefer a candy bar at the end or to know the answers. Everyone predicted
they\'d want the candy bar. But after the test, even though the
questions were trite, people chose to know the answers over the candy
bar. Like a mystery novel, couldn\'t stand not knowing.\
\
Just as imagination previews objects, so does it prefeel events.\
\
Before making a choice, some volunteers were asked to think logically,
whereas others were asked to make their choice quickly and \"from the
gut\". When asked days later about the result of their decision, the
thinkers were least satisfied. Nonthinkers trusted their prefeelings: if
imagining the future made them feel good, choosing that choice would
make them feel good, and they were right.\
\
Prefeeling allowed nonthinkers to predict their future satisfaction more
accurately than thinkers did. When people are prevented from feeling
emotion in the present, they become temporarily unable to predict how
they will feel in the future.\
\
When we ask our brains to look at a real object and an imaginary object
at the same time, our brains choose the real object. (Eyes open and
looking at something overrides imagining something.)\
\
When we try to ignore our current gloomy state and make a forecast about
how we will feel tomorrow, we find it\'s a lot like trying to imagine
the taste of marshmallow while chewing liver. It\'s only natural that we
should imagine the future and then consider how doing so makes us feel,
but because our brains are hell-bent on responding to current events, we
mistakenly conclude that we will feel tomorrow as we feel today.\
\
Volunteers in a no-variety group were more satisfied than volunteers in
the variety group. Variety made people less happy, not more.\
\
Wonderful things are especially wonderful the first time they happen,
but their wonderfulness wanes with repetition. (Think about the first
time your love said \"I love you\", versus the 100th time.)\
\
Time and variety are two ways to avoid habituation, and if you have one,
then you don\'t need the other.\
\
When episodes are sufficiently separated in time, variety is not only
unnecessary, it can actually be costly.\
\
Starting points have a profound impact on ending points. Starting points
matter because we often end up close to where we started. When people
predict future feelings by imagining a future event as though it were
happening in the present and then correcting for the event\'s actual
location in time, they make the same error.\
\
People prefer to have a job that pays \$30k, then \$40k, then \$50k -
rather than a job that earns \$60k, then \$50k, then \$40k, even though
the latter would earn more money.\
\
We don\'t think in absolute dollars. We think of relative dollars. (We
would drive across town to save \$50 on a \$100 radio, but not to save
\$50 on a \$100,000 car.)\
\
If you ask someone to pay an unrealistically large cost (\"could you
commit to coming to our rally every weekend this summer?\") before
asking them to pay a smaller amount (\"ok then could you at least
contribute \$20?\") - they\'re much more likely to agree to pay the
small cost after having contemplated the large one, in part because
doing so makes the small cost seem so bearable.\
\
People are more likely to purchase a vacation package that has been
marked down from \$600 to \$500 than an identical package that costs
\$400 that was on sale the previous day for \$300. We end up prefering
bad deals that have become decent deals to great deals that were once
amazing deals.\
\
People don\'t like to buy the most expensive item in a category, so
retailers can improve their sales by stocking a few very expensive items
that no one actually buys (a \$500 bottle of champagne) that makes less
expensive items seem like a bargain by comparison (a \$60 champagne).
Realestate people often bring clients to shitholes first, so that the
ordinary house feels like a miracle in comparison.\
\
People were given the opportunity to bid on a dictionary that was in
perfect condition and had 10,000 words. They bid \$24. Others given the
opportunity to bid on a dictionary with a torn cover but 20,000 words.
They bid \$20. When a different group was able to compare them
side-by-side, they bid \$19 for the small intact dictionary and \$27 for
the large torn dictionary. People care about an attribute (\# of words)
only when it is brought to their attention by side-by-side comparison.\
\
What do all these facts about comparison mean for our ability to imagine
future feelings?\
(a) - value is determined by the comparison of one thing to another\
(b) - there is more than one kind of comparison we can make in any given
instance\
(c) - we may value something more highly when we make one kind of
comparison than when we make a different kind of comparison.\
If we want to predict how something will make us feel in the future, we
must consider the kind of comparison we will be making in the future,
and not the kind of comparison we happen to be making in the present.\
\
When we start shopping for a new pair of sunglasses, we compare the cool
new ones in the store with the old outdated ones on our nose. But a few
days after buying the new ones, we stop comparing them with the old pair
and the delight that the comparison produced is gone.\
\
\"Presentism\": judging historical figures by contemporary standards.
Condemning Thomas Jefferson for keeping slaves or Sigmund Freud for
patronizing women is like arresting someone today for having driven
without a seat belt in 1923.\
\
\
People who don\'t have dire reactions to tragic events are sometimes
diagnosed as having \"absent grief\". Recent research shows conventional
wisdom is wrong, that the absence of grief is quite normal, and most
people are surprisingly resilient in the face of trauma.\
\
When people are asked to predict how they\'ll feel if a bad event
occurs, they consistently overestimate how awful they\'ll feel and how
long they\'ll feel awful.\
\
Researchers asked volunteers to write down their definition of
\"talented\", then to estimate their talent using that definition as a
guide. Other volunteers were given the definitions that the first group
had written down and were asked to estimate their own talent using those
definitions as a guide. The ones who defined \"talented\" rated
themselves as more talented than the non-definers. Because definers were
given the liberty to define the word talented any way they wished, they
defined it exactly as wished - in terms of some activity at which they
happened to excel.\
\
Because experiences are inherently ambiguous, finding a positive view of
an experience is done well and often. Racetrack gamblers evaluate their
horses more positively when they are leaving the betting window than
when they are approaching it. Same with voters. Objects are fine on
their own, but when they become \*our\* objects, they are instantly
finer. People are adept at finding a positive way to view things once
those things become their own.\
\
We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each
serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influence of the other,
and our experience of the world is inbetween.\
\
When volunteers in one study were told that they\'d scored poorly on an
IQ test, and were then given an opportunity to peruse articles about IQ
tests, they spent more time reading articles that questioned the
validity of such tests than articles that sanctioned them. When
volunteers in another study were given a glowing evaluation by a
supervisor, they were more interested in reading background information
that praised the supervisor\'s competence and acumen than background
information that impeached it.\
\
Half a group was shown that extraverts are more successful. Other half
shown that introverts are more successful. Then when asked to recall
events from their past to help determine which they were, they
remembered just the events that support the successful group they were
told.\
\
We spent countless hours and dollars arranging our lives to ensure that
we are surrounded by people who like us, and people who are like us.\
\
A question such as \"Am I the best lover you\'ve ever had?\" is
dangerous because it has only one answer that can make us truly happy.
\"What do you like best about my lovemaking?\" is brilliant because it
has only one answer that can make us truly miserable.\
\
96% of cancer patients claim to be in better health than the average
cancer patient.\
\
If we can\'t find people who are doing more poorly than we are, we
create them. Volunteers in one study took a test and were given the
opportunity to provide hints that would either help or hinder a
friend\'s performance on the same test. When described as a game, they
gave helpful hints. When described as an intelligence test, they gave
hindering hints.\
\
Although the word \"fact\" seems to suggest an unquestionable
irrefutability, facts are nothing more than conjectures that have met a
certain standard of proof. If we set that standard high enough, then
nothing can ever be proved, including the fact of our own existence.\
\
When we want to believe that someone is smart, a single letter of
recommendation may suffice. When we don\'t want to believe that person
is smart, we may demand a thick envelope full of transcripts, tests, and
testimony.\
\
It doesn\'t take much to convince us that we are smart and healthy, but
it takes a lot of facts to convince us of the opposite.\
\
People are typically unaware of the reasons why they are doing what they
are doing, but when asked for a reason, they readily supply one.\
\
Listening to a piece of music, some volunteers were told to just listen,
while others were told to listen while consciously trying to be happy.
The volunteers who had tried to be happy were in a worse mood than the
ones who had simply listened. Why? (1) deliberate attempts to be happy
tend to backfire and we end up feeling worse than we did before. (2)
deliberate attempts to cook the facts are so transparent that they make
us feel cheap.\
\
Nobody wants to be stood up at the altar, but those who have had it
happen say it was the best thing that happened to them. Like so many
things, getting jilted is more painful in prospect and more rosy in
retrospect.\
\
Most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish
inactions. But 90% of them are wrong. People in all walks of life seem
to regret NOT having done things much more than they regret things they
did. The most popular regrets are not going to college, not grasping
profitable business opportunities, and not spending enough time with
family and friends.\
\
It\'s harder to manufacture positive and credible views of inactions
than actions. When our inactions cause regret, we can\'t console
ourselves by thinking of all the things we learned from the experience
because there wasn\'t one.\
\
The intensity of suffering triggers defensive systems, which work to
help them achieve a credible and positive view of their experience. When
people are given electric shocks, they actually feel less pain when they
believe they are suffering for something of great value. The intense
shocks were unpleasant enough to trigger their psychological defenses,
but the mild shocks were not, hence they valued the club most when its
initiation was painful. That\'s why you can forgive your spouse for
cheating but stay angry about the dishes.\
\
You may ultimately feel better when you are the victim of an insult than
when you are bystander to it.\
\
We\'re more likely to look for and find a positive view of the things
we\'re stuck with than of the things we\'re not.\
\
It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to
change our view of the experience.\
\
We find silver linings only when we must.\
\
People try to explain events. When people do not complete the things
they set out to do, they are especially likely to think about and
remember their unfinished business. Once we explain an event, we can
fold it up nicely, put it away in memory\'s drawer, and move on to the
next one. But if an event defies explanation, it becomes a mystery or a
conundrum, which refuse to stay in the back of our mind.\
\
People choose certainty over uncertainty and clarity over mystery,
despite the fact that in both cases clarity and certainty had been shown
to diminish happiness.\
\
We naturally (but incorrectly) assume that things that come easily to
mind are things we have frequently encountered.\
\
Infrequent or unusual experiences are the most memorable.\
\
The fact that the least likely experience is often the most likely
memory can wreak havoc with our ability to predict future experiences.\
\
Memory\'s fetish for endings explains why women often remember
childbirth as less painful than it really was, and why couples whose
relationships have gone sour remember that they were never really happy
in the first place.\
\
Genes tend to be transmitted when they make us do things that transmit
genes.\
\
Wealth increases happiness when it lifts people out of poverty into
middle class, but it does little to increase happiness thereafter.\
\
Economies grow only if people are deluded into believing that the
production of wealth will make them happy.\
\
The belief that children are a source of happiness becomes a part of our
cultural wisdom simply because the opposite belief unravels the fabric
of any society that holds it.\
\
One way to make predictions about our own emotional futures is to find
someone who is having the experience we are contemplating and ask them
how they feel.\
\
The best way to predict our feelings tomorrow is to see how others are
feeling today.\
\
The average person doesn\'t see themselves as average. Most students see
themselves as more intelligent than the average student. Most business
managers see themselves as more competent than the average business
manager. Most football players see themselves as having better sense
than their teammates. 90% of motorists consider themselves to be
safer-than-average drivers. 94% of college professors consider
themselves to be better-than-average teachers. Ironically, our bias
towards seeing ourselves as better than average causes us to see
ourselves as less biased than average, too.\
\
This is general tendency to think of ourselves as different from others
- often for better but sometimes for worse. When people are asked about
generosity, they claim to perform a greater number of generous acts than
others do, but when asked about selfishness, they claim to perform a
greater number of selfish acts than others do. When people are asked
about their ability to perform an easy task, (driving, bike-riding),
they rate themselves better than others, but when asked about their
ability to perform a difficult task (juggling or playing chess), they
rate themselves as worse than others.\
\
We don\'t always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see
ourselves as unique.\
\
Surrogation is a cheap and effective way to predict one\'s future
emotions, but because we don\'t realize just how similar we all are, we
reject this reliable method and rely instead on our imaginations, as
flawed and fallible as they may be. :::

my notes
--------

The title of the book refers to two modes of thinking, which he refers
to as:\
\
\* "System 1" = The instant, unconscious, automatic, emotional,
intuitive thinking.\
\* "System 2" = The slower, conscious, rational, reasoning, deliberate
thinking.\
\
============\
EXPERTISE:\
\
Expert intuition: The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given
the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information
provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than
recognition.\
\
Valid intuitions develop when experts have learned to recognize familiar
elements in a new situation and to act in a manner that is appropriate
to it.\
\
Philip Tetlock\'s book \"Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How
Can We Know?\" - gathered more than 80,000 predictions. The experts
performed worse than they would have if they had simply assigned equal
probabilities. Even in the region they knew best, experts were not
significantly better than nonspecialists.\
\
People who spend their time, and earn their living, studying a
particular topic produce poorer predictions than dart-throwing monkeys.\
\
Those with the most knowledge are often less reliable. The reason is
that the person who acquires more knowledge develops an enhanced
illusion of her skill and becomes unrealistically overconfident.\
\
Hedgehogs "know one big thing" and have a theory about the world; they
account for particular events within a coherent framework, bristle with
impatience toward those who don't see things their way, and are
confident in their forecasts. They are also especially reluctant to
admit error.\
\
It is much easier to strive for perfection when you are never bored.\
\
Flow neatly separates the two forms of effort: concentration on the task
and the deliberate control of attention.\
\
In a state of flow, maintaining focused attention on these absorbing
activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing
resources to be directed to the task at hand.\
\
Many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their
intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly
unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible.\
\
Putting the participants in a good mood before the test by having them
think happy thoughts more than doubled accuracy. An even more striking
result is that unhappy subjects were completely incapable of performing
the intuitive task accurately; their guesses were no better than random.
Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are
uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.\
\
When in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but
also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. Here again, as in
the mere exposure effect, the connection makes biological sense. A good
mood is a signal that things are generally going well, the environment
is safe, and it is all right to let one's guard down. A bad mood
indicates that things are not going very well, there may be a threat,
and vigilance is required.\
\
Surprise itself is the most sensitive indication of how we understand
our world and what we expect from it.\
\
The main function of System 1 is to maintain and update a model of your
personal world, which represents what is normal in it.\
\
When System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will believe almost anything.
System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of
doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often
lazy.\
\
Understanding a statement must begin with an attempt to believe it: you
must first know what the idea would mean if it were true. Only then can
you decide whether or not to unbelieve it. The initial attempt to
believe is an automatic operation of System 1.\
\
Unbelieving is an operation of System 2.\
\
The operations of associative memory contribute to a general
confirmation bias. When asked, "Is Sam friendly?" different instances of
Sam's behavior will come to mind than would if you had been asked "Is
Sam unfriendly?" A deliberate search for confirming evidence, known as
positive test strategy, is also how System 2 tests a hypothesis.
Contrary to the rules of philosophers of science, who advise testing
hypotheses by trying to refute them, people (and scientists, quite
often) seek data that are likely to be compatible with the beliefs they
currently hold. The confirmatory bias of System 1 favors uncritical
acceptance of suggestions and exaggeration of the likelihood of extreme
and improbable events.\
\
Herbert Simon's definition of intuition: Expertise in a domain is not a
single skill but rather a large collection of miniskills.\
\
The confidence that people have in their intuitions is not a reliable
guide to their validity. In other words, do not trust anyone - including
yourself - to tell you how much you should trust their judgment.\
\
When do judgments reflect true expertise?\
An environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable an
opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice.\
When both these conditions are satisfied, intuitions are likely to be
skilled.\
\
Intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the
environment.\
\
If the environment is sufficiently regular and if the judge has had a
chance to learn its regularities, the associative machinery will
recognize situations and generate quick and accurate predictions and
decisions. You can trust someone's intuitions if these conditions are
met.\
\
When evaluating expert intuition you should always consider whether
there was an adequate opportunity to learn the cues, even in a regular
environment.\
\
"Does he really believe that the environment of start-ups is
sufficiently regular to justify an intuition that goes against the base
rates?"\
\
"Did he really have an opportunity to learn? How quick and how clear was
the feedback he received on his judgments?"\
\
The proper way to elicit information from a group is not by starting
with a public discussion but by confidentially collecting each person's
judgment.\
\
\
============\
JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS\
\
The way to block errors that originate in System 1 is simple in
principle: recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield,
slow down, and ask for reinforcement from System 2.\
\
When you see lines with fins pointing in different directions, you will
recognize the situation as one in which you should not trust your
impressions of length. Unfortunately, this sensible procedure is least
likely to be applied when it is needed most.\
\
Organizations are better than individuals when it comes to avoiding
errors, because they naturally think more slowly and have the power to
impose orderly procedures. Organizations can institute and enforce the
application of useful checklists,\
\
When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available,
intuition still has a shot: an answer may come to mind quickly - but it
is not an answer to the original question.\
\
When faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one
instead, usually without noticing the substitution.\
\
An easy question (How do I feel about it?) serves as an answer to a much
harder question (What do I think about it?).\
\
System 1 effortlessly originates impressions and feelings that are the
main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System
2.\
The automatic operations of System 1 generate surprisingly complex
patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts
in an orderly series of steps.\
\
You can also feel a surge of conscious attention whenever you are
surprised. System 2 is activated when an event is detected that violates
the model of the world that System 1 maintains.\
\
Most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System
1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally
has the last word.\
\
Continuous vigilance is not necessarily good, and it is certainly
impractical. Constantly questioning our own thinking would be impossibly
tedious, and System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a
substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we can do
is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are
likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes\
\
Anything that occupies your working memory reduces your ability to
think.\
\
Test Questions were chosen because they also invite an intuitive answer
that is both compelling and wrong:\
Students who scored very low on this test - their supervisory function
of System 2 is weak - and they are prone to answer questions with the
first idea that comes to mind and unwilling to invest the effort needed
to check their intuitions.\
Individuals who uncritically follow their intuitions about puzzles are
also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. In particular,
they are impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate
gratification.\
\
What makes some people more susceptible than others to biases of
judgment? Stanovich published his conclusions in a book titled
Rationality and the Reflective Mind.\
\
Superficial or "lazy" thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a
failure of rationality.\
\
Rationality should be distinguished from intelligence.\
\
When information is scarce, which is a common occurrence, System 1
operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions. You did not start by
asking, "What would I need to know before I formed an opinion about the
quality of someone's leadership?" System 1 got to work on its own from
the first adjective.\
\
The combination of a coherence-seeking System 1 with a lazy System 2
implies that System 2 will endorse many intuitive beliefs, which closely
reflect the impressions generated by System 1.\
\
Based on brief exposure to photographs and without any political
context: In about 70% of the races for senator, congressman, and
governor, the election winner was the candidate whose face had earned a
higher rating of competence.\
\
A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are rarely stumped.
You have intuitive feelings and opinions about almost everything that
comes your way. You often have answers to questions that you do not
completely understand, relying on evidence that you can neither explain
nor defend.\
\
If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System
1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it.\
\
If they had been given indefinite time and told to follow logic and not
to answer until they were sure of their answer, I believe that most of
our subjects would have avoided the conjunction fallacy. However, their
vacation did not depend on a correct answer; they spent very little time
on it, and were content to answer as if they had only been "asked for
their opinion." The laziness of System 2 is an important fact of life.\
\
Following our intuitions is more natural, and somehow more pleasant,
than acting against them.\
\
You cannot help dealing with the limited information you have as if it
were all there is to know. You build the best possible story from the
information available to you, and if it is a good story, you believe it.
Paradoxically, it is easier to construct a coherent story when you know
little, when there are fewer pieces to fit into the puzzle. Our
comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure
foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.\
\
Poor evidence can make a very good story.\
\
For some of our most important beliefs we have no evidence at all,
except that people we love and trust hold these beliefs.\
\
Cognitive illusions can be more stubborn than visual illusions. What you
learned about the Müller-Lyer illusion did not change the way you see
the lines.\
\
Intuition adds value, but only after a disciplined collection of
objective information and disciplined scoring of separate traits.\
\
Do not simply trust intuitive judgment - your own or that of others -
but do not dismiss it, either.\
\
\
\
============\
STATISTICS\
\
People are prone to apply causal thinking inappropriately, to situations
that require statistical reasoning. Statistical thinking derives
conclusions about individual cases from properties of categories and
ensembles. Unfortunately, System 1 does not have the capability for this
mode of reasoning; System 2 can learn to think statistically, but few
people receive the necessary training.\
\
From the same urn, two very patient marble counters take turns. Jack
draws 4 marbles on each trial, Jill draws 7. They both record each time
they observe a homogeneous sample - all white or all red. If they go on
long enough, Jack will observe such extreme outcomes more often than
Jill - by a factor of 8 (the expected percentages are 12.5% and 1.56%).
Again, no hammer, no causation, but a mathematical fact: samples of 4
marbles yield extreme results more often than samples of 7 marbles do.
Now imagine the population of the United States as marbles in a giant
urn. Some marbles are marked KC, for kidney cancer. You draw samples of
marbles and populate each county in turn. Rural samples are smaller than
other samples. Just as in the game of Jack and Jill, extreme outcomes
(very high and/or very low cancer rates) are most likely to be found in
sparsely populated counties. This is all there is to the story.\
\
People should regard their statistical intuitions with proper suspicion
and replace impression formation by computation whenever possible.\
\
We are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see.
The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few
observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often
get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know
very little.\
\
The associative machinery seeks causes. The difficulty we have with
statistical regularities is that they call for a different approach.
Instead of focusing on how the event at hand came to be, the statistical
view relates it to what could have happened instead. Nothing in
particular caused it to be what it is - chance selected it from among
its alternatives. Our predilection for causal thinking exposes us to
serious mistakes in evaluating the randomness of truly random events.\
\
Bad schools also tend to be smaller than average. The truth is that
small schools are not better on average; they are simply more variable.\
\
A basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks:
we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight -
nothing in between.\
\
We tend to overweight small risks and are willing to pay far more than
expected value to eliminate them altogether.\
\
When an unlikely event becomes the focus of attention, we will assign it
much more weight than its probability deserves.\
\
Reducing or mitigating the risk is not adequate; to eliminate the worry
the probability must be brought down to zero.\
\
People overestimate the probabilities of unlikely events. People
overweight unlikely events in their decisions.\
\
What is the probability that a baby born in your local hospital will be
released within three days? You were asked to estimate the probability
of the baby going home, but you almost certainly focused on the events
that might cause a baby not to be released within the normal period. Our
mind has a useful capability to focus spontaneously on whatever is odd,
different, or unusual.\
\
The unlikely event became focal.\
\
Your estimate of the frequency of problems was too high.\
\
The successful execution of a plan is specific and easy to imagine when
one tries to forecast the outcome of a project. In contrast, the
alternative of failure is diffuse, because there are innumerable ways
for things to go wrong. Entrepreneurs and the investors who evaluate
their prospects are prone both to overestimate their chances and to
overweight their estimates.\
\
The decision weight for a 90% chance was 71.2 and the decision weight
for a 10% chance was 18.6.\
\
The valuation of gambles was much less sensitive to probability when the
(fictitious) outcomes were emotional, than when the outcomes were gains
or losses of cash.\
\
The fear of an impending electric shock was essentially uncorrelated
with the probability of receiving the shock. The mere possibility of a
shock triggered the full-blown fear response.\
\
Urn A contains 10 marbles, of which 1 is red.\
Urn B contains 100 marbles, of which 8 are red.\
30%--40% of students choose the urn with the larger number of winning
marbles, rather than the urn that provides a better chance of winning.\
\
If your attention is drawn to the winning marbles, you do not assess the
number of nonwinning marbles with the same care. Vivid imagery
contributes to denominator neglect.\
\
Low-probability events are much more heavily weighted when described in
terms of relative frequencies (how many) than when stated in more
abstract terms of "chances," "risk," or "probability" (how likely). As
we have seen, System 1 is much better at dealing with individuals than
categories.\
\
"A disease that kills 1,286 people out of every 10,000" was judged more
dangerous than a disease that "kills 24.4 out of 100."\
\
\
============\
PRIMING / ANCHORING\
\
Your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are
not even aware.\
\
The common admonition to "act calm and kind regardless of how you feel"
is very good advice: You are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling
calm and kind.\
\
Money-primed people become more independent than they would be without
the associative trigger. They persevered almost twice as long in trying
to solve a very difficult problem before they asked the experimenter for
help, a crisp demonstration of increased self-reliance. Money-primed
people are also more selfish: they were much less willing to spend time
helping another student who pretended to be confused about an
experimental task. When an experimenter clumsily dropped a bunch of
pencils on the floor, the participants with money (unconsciously) on
their mind picked up fewer pencils.\
\
Money-primed undergraduates also showed a greater preference for being
alone. The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money
primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend
on others, or to accept demands from others. The psychologist who has
done this remarkable research, Kathleen Vohs,\
\
Living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape
our behavior and our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of
which we may not be proud. Some cultures provide frequent reminders of
respect, others constantly remind their members of God, and some
societies prime obedience by large images of the Dear Leader.\
\
Reminding people of their mortality increases the appeal of
authoritarian ideas, which may become reassuring in the context of the
terror of death.\
\
Feeling that one's soul is stained appears to trigger a desire to
cleanse one's body.\
\
A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent
repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.\
\
Words that were presented more frequently were rated much more favorably
than the words that had been shown only once or twice.\
\
Biological fact: an organism should react cautiously to a novel
stimulus, with withdrawal and fear.\
\
If repeated exposure of a stimulus is followed by nothing bad, such a
stimulus will eventually become a safety signal.\
\
The evaluation of the risk depends on the choice of a measure - with the
obvious possibility that the choice may have been guided by a preference
for one outcome or another. He goes on to conclude that "defining risk
is thus an exercise in power."\
\
\
============\
AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC\
\
The experience of familiarity has a simple but powerful quality of
'pastness' that seems to indicate that it is a direct reflection of
prior experience.\
This quality of pastness is an illusion.\
A name you\'ve seen before will look familiar when you see it because
you will see it more clearly. Words that you have seen before become
easier to see again - you can identify them better than other words when
they are shown very briefly or masked by noise, and you will be quicker
(by a few hundredths of a second) to read them than to read other words.
In short, you experience greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word you
have seen earlier, and it is this sense of ease that gives you the
impression of familiarity.\
\
Information that is not retrieved (even unconsciously) from memory might
as well not exist. System 1 excels at constructing the best possible
story that incorporates ideas currently activated, but it does not
(cannot) allow for information it does not have. The measure of success
for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create.\
\
Availability heuristic, like other heuristics of judgment, substitutes
one question for another: you wish to estimate the size of a category or
the frequency of an event, but you report an impression of the ease with
which instances come to mind.\
\
Discover how the heuristic leads to biases by following a simple
procedure: list factors other than frequency that make it easy to come
up with instances. Each factor in your list will be a potential source
of bias.\
\
People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce
more arguments to support it.\
\
Students who listed more ways to improve the class rated it higher!\
\
Death by accidents was judged to be more than 300 times more likely than
death by diabetes, but the true ratio is 1:4. The lesson is clear:
estimates of causes of death are warped by media coverage. The coverage
is itself biased toward novelty and poignancy.\
\
The ease with which ideas of various risks come to mind and the
emotional reactions to these risks are inextricably linked. Frightening
thoughts and images occur to us with particular ease, and thoughts of
danger that are fluent and vivid exacerbate fear.\
\
Anchoring effect. It occurs when people consider a particular value for
an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. What happens is one
of the most reliable and robust results of experimental psychology: the
estimates stay close to the number that people considered.\
\
The same house will appear more valuable if its listing price is high
than if it is low, even if you are determined to resist the influence of
this number.\
\
Any number that you are asked to consider as a possible solution to an
estimation problem will induce an anchoring effect.\
\
On some days, a sign on the shelf said limit of 12 per person. On other
days, the sign said no limit per person. Shoppers purchased an average
of 7 cans when the limit was in force, twice as many as they bought when
the limit was removed. Anchoring is not the sole explanation. Rationing
also implies that the goods are flying off the shelves, and shoppers
should feel some urgency about stocking up.\
\
\
============\
STEREOTYPES\
\
Stereotypes are statements about the group that are (at least
tentatively) accepted as facts about every member. Here are two
examples: Most of the graduates of this inner-city school go to college.
Interest in cycling is widespread in France.\
\
You will be reminded of these facts when you think about the likelihood
that a particular graduate of the school will attend college, or when
you wonder whether to bring up the Tour de France in a conversation with
a Frenchman you just met.   Stereotyping is a bad word in our culture,
but in my usage it is neutral. One of the basic characteristics of
System 1 is that it represents categories as norms and prototypical
exemplars.\
\
In sensitive social contexts, we do not want to draw possibly erroneous
conclusions about the individual from the statistics of the group. We
consider it morally desirable for base rates to be treated as
statistical facts about the group rather than as presumptive facts about
individuals. In other words, we reject causal base rates. The social
norm against stereotyping, including the opposition to profiling, has
been highly beneficial in creating a more civilized and more equal
society. It is useful to remember, however, that neglecting valid
stereotypes inevitably results in suboptimal judgments. Resistance to
stereotyping is a laudable moral position, but the simplistic idea that
the resistance is costless is wrong. The costs are worth paying to
achieve a better society, but denying that the costs exist, while
satisfying to the soul and politically correct, is not scientifically
defensible.\
\
\
============\
REVERT TO THE MEAN\
\
When you have doubts about the quality of the evidence: let your
judgments of probability stay close to the base rate.\
\
How to Discipline Intuition:\
\
You should not let yourself believe whatever comes to your mind. To be
useful, your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability.\
\
Base rates matter, even in the presence of evidence about the case at
hand.\
\
Intuitive impressions of the diagnosticity of evidence are often
exaggerated.\
\
The combination of WYSIATI and associative coherence tends to make us
believe in the stories we spin for ourselves.\
\
Anchor your judgment of the probability of an outcome on a plausible
base rate. Question the diagnosticity of your evidence.\
\
"This start-up looks as if it could not fail, but the base rate of
success in the industry is extremely low. How do we know this case is
different?"\
\
"They keep making the same mistake: predicting rare events from weak
evidence. When the evidence is weak, one should stick with the base
rates."\
\
An important principle of skill training: rewards for improved
performance work better than punishment of mistakes.\
\
A significant fact of the human condition: the feedback to which life
exposes us is perverse. Because we tend to be nice to other people when
they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished
for being nice and rewarded for being nasty.\
\
The "Sports Illustrated jinx," the claim that an athlete whose picture
appears on the cover of the magazine is doomed to perform poorly the
following season. Overconfidence and the pressure of meeting high
expectations are often offered as explanations. But there is a simpler
account of the jinx: an athlete who gets to be on the cover of Sports
Illustrated must have performed exceptionally well in the preceding
season, probably with the assistance of a nudge from luck - and luck is
fickle.\
\
If you treated a group of depressed children for some time with an
energy drink, they would show a clinically significant improvement. It
is also the case that depressed children who spend some time standing on
their head or hug a cat for twenty minutes a day will also show
improvement. Most readers of such headlines will automatically infer
that the energy drink or the cat hugging caused an improvement, but this
conclusion is completely unjustified. Depressed children are an extreme
group, they are more depressed than most other children - and extreme
groups regress to the mean over time. The correlation between depression
scores on successive occasions of testing is less than perfect, so there
will be regression to the mean: depressed children will get somewhat
better over time even if they hug no cats and drink no Red Bull. In
order to conclude that an energy drink - or any other treatment - is
effective, you must compare a group of patients who receive this
treatment to a "control group" that receives no treatment (or, better,
receives a placebo). The control group is expected to improve by
regression alone, and the aim of the experiment is to determine whether
the treated patients improve more than regression can explain.\
\
"She says experience has taught her that criticism is more effective
than praise. What she doesn't understand is that it's all due to
regression to the mean."\
"Perhaps his second interview was less impressive than the first because
he was afraid of disappointing us, but more likely it was his first that
was unusually good."\
\
The basic message of Built to Last and other similar books is that good
managerial practices can be identified and that good practices will be
rewarded by good results. Both messages are overstated. The comparison
of firms that have been more or less successful is to a significant
extent a comparison between firms that have been more or less lucky.
Knowing the importance of luck, you should be particularly suspicious
when highly consistent patterns emerge from the comparison of successful
and less successful firms. In the presence of randomness, regular
patterns can only be mirages.\
\
On average, the gap in corporate profitability and stock returns between
the outstanding firms and the less successful firms studied in Built to
Last shrank to almost nothing in the period following the study.\
\
A study of Fortune's "Most Admired Companies" finds that over a
twenty-year period, the firms with the worst ratings went on to earn
much higher stock returns than the most admired firms.\
\
The average gap must shrink, because the original gap was due in good
part to luck, which contributed both to the success of the top firms and
to the lagging performance of the rest. We have already encountered this
statistical fact of life: regression to the mean.\
\
\
============\
PREDICTIONS\
\
Philip Tetlock\'s book \"Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How
Can We Know?\" - gathered more than 80,000 predictions. The experts
performed worse than they would have if they had simply assigned equal
probabilities. Even in the region they knew best, experts were not
significantly better than nonspecialists.\
\
People who spend their time, and earn their living, studying a
particular topic produce poorer predictions than dart-throwing monkeys.\
\
"Miswanting": bad choices that arise from errors of affective
forecasting.\
\
Eliminating redundancy from your sources of information is always a good
idea.\
\
The magic of error reduction works well only when the observations are
independent and their errors uncorrelated. If the observers share a
bias, the aggregation of judgments will not reduce it. Allowing the
observers to influence each other effectively reduces the size of the
sample, and with it the precision of the group estimate. To derive the
most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should
always try to make these sources independent of each other.\
\
The prediction of the future is not distinguished from an evaluation of
current evidence - prediction matches evaluation.\
\
People are asked for a prediction but they substitute an evaluation of
the evidence, without noticing that the question they answer is not the
one they were asked. This process is guaranteed to generate predictions
that are systematically biased; they completely ignore regression to the
mean.\
\
Start with an estimate of average GPA. Determine the GPA that matches
your impression of the evidence. Estimate the correlation between your
evidence and GPA. If the correlation is .30, move 30% of the distance
from the average to the matching GPA.\
\
Suppose that I predict for each golfer in a tournament that his score on
day 2 will be the same as his score on day 1. This prediction does not
allow for regression to the mean: the golfers who fared well on day 1
will on average do less well on day 2, and those who did poorly will
mostly improve. When they are eventually compared to actual outcomes,
nonregressive predictions will be found to be biased. They are on
average overly optimistic for those who did best on the first day and
overly pessimistic for those who had a bad start.\
\
Similarly, if you use childhood achievements to predict grades in
college without regressing your predictions toward the mean, you will
more often than not be disappointed by the academic outcomes of early
readers and happily surprised by the grades of those who learned to read
relatively late. The corrected intuitive predictions eliminate these
biases.\
\
A baseline prediction, which you would make if you knew nothing about
the case at hand. In the categorical case, it was the base rate. In the
numerical case, it is the average outcome in the relevant category.\
An intuitive prediction, which expresses the number that comes to your
mind.\
Aim for a prediction that is intermediate between the baseline and your
intuitive response.\
In the default case of no useful evidence, you stay with the baseline.\
\
Find some reason to doubt that the correlation between your intuitive
judgment and the truth is perfect, and you will end up somewhere between
the two poles.\
\
Intuitive predictions tend to be overconfident and overly extreme.\
\
Correcting your intuitions may complicate your life.\
\
Unbiased predictions permit the prediction of rare or extreme events
only when the information is very good. If you expect your predictions
to be of modest validity, you will never guess an outcome that is either
rare or far from the mean. If your predictions are unbiased, you will
never have the satisfying experience of correctly calling an extreme
case. You will never be able to say, "I thought so!"\
\
The ultimate test of an explanation is whether it would have made the
event predictable in advance.\
\
We can know something only if it is both true and knowable. But the
crisis was not knowable. What is perverse about the use of know in this
context is not that some individuals get credit for prescience that they
do not deserve. It is that the language implies that the world is more
knowable than it is. It helps perpetuate a pernicious illusion.\
\
\
============\
CAUSAL\
\
Our mind is strongly biased toward causal explanations.\
\
Students "quietly exempt themselves" (and their friends and
acquaintances) from the conclusions of experiments that surprise them.\
\
When they presented their students with a surprising statistical fact,
the students managed to learn nothing at all. But when the students were
surprised by individual cases - two nice people who had not helped -
they immediately made the generalization.\
\
Subjects' unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was
matched only by their willingness to infer the general from the
particular. This is a profoundly important conclusion. People who are
taught surprising statistical facts about human behavior may be
impressed to the point of telling their friends about what they have
heard, but this does not mean that their understanding of the world has
really changed. The test of learning psychology is whether your
understanding of situations you encounter has changed, not whether you
have learned a new fact.\
\
Surprising individual cases have a powerful impact and are a more
effective tool for teaching psychology because the incongruity must be
resolved and embedded in a causal story.\
\
You are more likely to learn something by finding surprises in your own
behavior than by hearing surprising facts about people in general.\
\
When our attention is called to an event, associative memory will look
for its cause. Any cause that is already stored in memory. Causal
explanations will be evoked when regression is detected, but they will
be wrong because the truth is that regression to the mean has an
explanation but does not have a cause.\
\
The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are
concrete rather than abstract; assign a larger role to talent,
stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking
events that happened rather than on the countless events that failed to
happen.\
\
\
============\
RANDOMNESS\
\
Success = talent + luck great success = a little more talent + a lot of
luck.\
\
The idea that the future is unpredictable is undermined every day by the
ease with which the past is explained.\
\
The idea that large historical events are determined by luck is
profoundly shocking, although it is demonstrably true.\
\
The line that separates the possibly predictable future from the
unpredictable distant future is yet to be drawn.\
\
\
============\
INVESTING\
\
Absence of bias is not always what matters most.\
\
A venture capitalist will never be told that the probability of success
for a start-up in its early stages is "very high."\
\
When a venture capitalist looks for "the next big thing," the risk of
missing the next Google or Facebook is far more important than the risk
of making a modest investment in a start-up that ultimately fails. The
goal of venture capitalists is to call the extreme cases correctly, even
at the cost of overestimating the prospects of many other ventures.\
\
Some of us may need the security of distorted estimates to avoid
paralysis. If you choose to delude yourself by accepting extreme
predictions, however, you will do well to remain aware of your
self-indulgence. Perhaps the most valuable contribution of the
corrective procedures I propose is that they will require you to think
about how much you know.\
\
I have heard of too many people who "knew well before it happened that
the 2008 financial crisis was inevitable."\
\
When an unpredicted event occurs, we immediately adjust our view of the
world to accommodate the surprise.\
\
We have an imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of knowledge.\
\
Once you adopt a new view of the world (or of any part of it), you
immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe
before your mind changed.\
\
The illusion that one has understood the past feeds the further illusion
that one can predict and control the future. These illusions are
comforting. They reduce the anxiety that we would experience if we
allowed ourselves to fully acknowledge the uncertainties of existence.
We all have a need for the reassuring message that actions have
appropriate consequences, and that success will reward wisdom and
courage. Many business books are tailor-made to satisfy this need.\
\
"When you sell a stock," I asked, "who buys it?" He answered with a wave
in the vague direction of the window, indicating that he expected the
buyer to be someone else very much like him. That was odd: What made one
person buy and the other sell? What did the sellers think they knew that
the buyers did not?\
\
A major industry appears to be built largely on an illusion of skill.\
\
The buyers and sellers know that they have the same information; they
exchange the stocks primarily because they have different opinions.\
\
If all assets in a market are correctly priced, no one can expect either
to gain or to lose by trading. Perfect prices leave no scope for
cleverness, but they also protect fools from their own folly.\
\
For the large majority of individual investors, taking a shower and
doing nothing would have been a better policy than implementing the
ideas that came to their minds.\
\
Individual investors predictably flock to companies that draw their
attention because they are in the news. Professional investors are more
selective in responding to news. These findings provide some
justification for the label of "smart money" that finance professionals
apply to themselves.\
\
A basic test of skill: persistent achievement. The diagnostic for the
existence of any skill is the consistency of individual differences in
achievement.\
\
The illusion of skill is not only an individual aberration; it is deeply
ingrained in the culture of the industry. Facts that challenge such
basic assumptions - and thereby threaten people's livelihood and
self-esteem - are simply not absorbed. The mind does not digest them.\
\
Skill in evaluating the business prospects of a firm is not sufficient
for successful stock trading, where the key question is whether the
information about the firm is already incorporated in the price of its
stock. Traders apparently lack the skill to answer this crucial
question, but they appear to be ignorant of their ignorance.\
\
Large numbers of individuals in that world believe themselves to be
among the chosen few who can do what they believe others cannot.\
\
The financial benefits of self-employment are mediocre: given the same
qualifications, people achieve higher average returns by selling their
skills to employers than by setting out on their own. The evidence
suggests that optimism is widespread, stubborn, and costly.\
\
Daniel Bernoulli argued that a gift of 10 ducats has the same utility to
someone who already has 100 ducats as a gift of 20 ducats to someone
whose current wealth is 200 ducats.\
\
The psychological response to a change of wealth is inversely
proportional to the initial amount of wealth.\
\
A decision maker with diminishing marginal utility for wealth will be
risk averse.\
\
Much more likely to take her chances, as others do when faced with very
bad options.\
\
Once you have accepted a theory and used it as a tool in your thinking,
it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws. If you come upon an
observation that does not seem to fit the model, you assume that there
must be a perfectly good explanation that you are somehow missing. You
give the theory the benefit of the doubt, trusting the community of
experts who have accepted it.\
\
Disbelieving is hard work, and System 2 is easily tired.\
\
People become risk seeking when all their options are bad.\
\
Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a
better chance to survive and reproduce.\
\
In mixed gambles, where both a gain and a loss are possible, loss
aversion causes extremely risk-averse choices. In bad choices, where a
sure loss is compared to a larger loss that is merely probable,
diminishing sensitivity causes risk seeking.\
\
Diminishing marginal utility: the more leisure you have, the less you
care for an extra day of it, and each added day is worth less than the
one before. Similarly, the more income you have, the less you care for
an extra dollar, and the amount you are willing to give up for an extra
day of leisure increases.\
\
A mistaken assumption: that your utility for a state of affairs depends
only on that state and is not affected by your history.\
\
When you shop for shoes, the merchant who gives up the shoes in exchange
for money certainly feels no loss. Indeed, the shoes that he hands over
have always been, from his point of view, a cumbersome proxy for money
that he was hoping to collect from some consumer. Furthermore, you
probably do not experience paying the merchant as a loss, because you
were effectively holding money as a proxy for the shoes you intended to
buy.\
\
Both the shoes the merchant sells you and the money you spend from your
budget for shoes are held "for exchange." They are intended to be traded
for other goods. Other goods, such as wine and Super Bowl tickets, are
held "for use," to be consumed or otherwise enjoyed.\
\
Your leisure time and the standard of living that your income supports
are also not intended for sale or exchange.\
\
Only 18% of the inexperienced traders were willing to exchange their
gift for the other. In sharp contrast, experienced traders showed no
trace of an endowment effect: 48% of them traded!\
\
People who are poor think like traders, but all their choices are
between losses. Money that is spent on one good is the loss of another
good that could have been purchased instead. For the poor, costs are
losses.\
\
Asked a friend whether he would accept a gamble on the toss of a coin in
which he could lose \$100 or win \$200. His friend responded, "I won't
bet because I would feel the \$100 loss more than the \$200 gain. But
I'll take you on if you promise to let me make 100 such bets."\
\
I sympathize with your aversion to losing any gamble, but it is costing
you a lot of money.\
\
Is this the last offer of a small favorable gamble that you will ever
consider?\
\
You will have many opportunities to consider attractive gambles with
stakes that are very small relative to your wealth. You will do yourself
a large financial favor if you are able to see each of these gambles as
part of a bundle of small gambles.\
\
Rehearse the mantra that will get you significantly closer to economic
rationality: you win a few, you lose a few. The main purpose of the
mantra is to control your emotional response when you do lose.\
\
The mantra works when the gambles are genuinely independent of each
other; it does not apply to multiple investments in the same industry,
which would all go bad together. It works only when the possible loss
does not cause you to worry about your total wealth. If you would take
the loss as significant bad news about your economic future, watch it!
It should not be applied to long shots, where the probability of winning
is very small for each bet. If you have the emotional discipline that
this rule requires, you will never consider a small gamble in isolation
or be loss averse for a small gamble.\
\
Broad framing blunted the emotional reaction to losses and increased the
willingness to take risks. The combination of loss aversion and narrow
framing is a costly curse. Individual investors can avoid that curse,
achieving the emotional benefits of broad framing while also saving time
and agony, by reducing the frequency with which they check how well
their investments are doing. Closely following daily fluctuations is a
losing proposition, because the pain of the frequent small losses
exceeds the pleasure of the equally frequent small gains.\
\
The deliberate avoidance of exposure to short-term outcomes improves the
quality of both decisions and outcomes.\
\
A commitment not to change one's position for several periods (the
equivalent of "locking in" an investment) improves financial
performance.\
\
Having a risk policy that they routinely apply whenever a relevant
problem arises. Familiar examples of risk policies are "always take the
highest possible deductible when purchasing insurance" and "never buy
extended warranties." A risk policy is a broad frame.\
\
Reduce or eliminate the pain of the occasional loss by the thought that
the policy that left you exposed to it will almost certainly be
financially advantageous over the long run.\
\
The outside view and the risk policy are remedies against two distinct
biases that affect many decisions: the exaggerated optimism of the
planning fallacy and the exaggerated caution induced by loss aversion.\
\
Top managers of the 25 divisions of a large company. He asked them to
consider a risky option in which, with equal probabilities, they could
lose a large amount of the capital they controlled or earn double that
amount. None of the executives was willing to take such a dangerous
gamble. Thaler then turned to the CEO of the company, who was also
present, and asked for his opinion. Without hesitation, the CEO
answered, "I would like all of them to accept their risks." In the
context of that conversation, it was natural for the CEO to adopt a
broad frame that encompassed all 25 bets.\
\
He could count on statistical aggregation to mitigate the overall risk.\
\
Money is a proxy for points on a scale of self-regard and achievement.\
\
Finance research has documented a massive preference for selling winners
rather than losers - a bias that has been given an opaque label: the
disposition effect. The disposition effect is an instance of narrow
framing. The investor has set up an account for each share that she
bought, and she wants to close every account as a gain. A rational agent
would have a comprehensive view of the portfolio.\
\
The sunk-cost fallacy keeps people for too long in poor jobs, unhappy
marriages, and unpromising research projects.\
\
\
============\
ALGORITHMS\
\
Each of these domains entails a significant degree of uncertainty and
unpredictability. We describe them as "low-validity environments." In
every case, the accuracy of experts was matched or exceeded by a simple
algorithm.\
\
Clinical vs. Statistical Prediction: A Theoretical Analysis and a Review
of the Evidence.\
\
Orley Ashenfelter has offered a compelling demonstration of the power of
simple statistics to outdo world-renowned experts. Ashenfelter wanted to
predict the future value of fine Bordeaux wines from information
available in the year they are made.\
\
Ashenfelter converted that conventional knowledge into a statistical
formula that predicts the price of a wine - for a particular property
and at a particular age - by three features of the weather: the average
temperature over the summer growing season, the amount of rain at
harvest-time, and the total rainfall during the previous winter. His
formula provides accurate price forecasts years and even decades into
the future. Indeed, his formula forecasts future prices much more
accurately than the current prices of young wines do.\
\
Ashenfelter's formula is extremely accurate - the correlation between
his predictions and actual prices is above .90.\
\
Why are experts inferior to algorithms? One reason, which Meehl
suspected, is that experts try to be clever, think outside the box, and
consider complex combinations of features in making their predictions.
Complexity may work in the odd case, but more often than not it reduces
validity. Simple combinations of features are better.\
\
Human decision makers are inferior to a prediction formula even when
they are given the score suggested by the formula! They feel that they
can overrule the formula because they have additional information.\
\
There are few circumstances under which it is a good idea to substitute
judgment for a formula. In a famous thought experiment, he described a
formula that predicts whether a particular person will go to the movies
tonight and noted that it is proper to disregard the formula if
information is received that the individual broke a leg today. The name
"broken-leg rule" has stuck. The point, of course, is that broken legs
are very rare - as well as decisive.\
\
To maximize predictive accuracy, final decisions should be left to
formulas, especially in low-validity environments.\
\
It is possible to develop useful algorithms without any prior
statistical research. Simple equally weighted formulas based on existing
statistics or on common sense are often very good predictors of
significant outcomes.\
\
Marital stability is well predicted by a formula: frequency of
lovemaking minus frequency of quarrels.\
\
An algorithm that is constructed on the back of an envelope is often
good enough to compete with an optimally weighted formula, and certainly
good enough to outdo expert judgment.\
\
If you are serious about hiring the best possible person for the job,
this is what you should do. First, select a few traits that are
prerequisites for success in this position (technical proficiency,
engaging personality, reliability, and so on). Don't overdo it - six
dimensions is a good number. The traits you choose should be as
independent as possible from each other, and you should feel that you
can assess them reliably by asking a few factual questions. Next, make a
list of those questions for each trait and think about how you will
score it, say on a 1--5 scale.\
\
Collect the information on one trait at a time, scoring each before you
move on to the next one. Do not skip around. To evaluate each candidate,
add up the six scores.\
\
Firmly resolve that you will hire the candidate whose final score is the
highest, even if there is another one whom you like better - try to
resist your wish to invent broken legs to change the ranking.\
\
\
============\
OUTSIDE VIEW\
\
Baseline prediction: the prediction you make about a case if you know
nothing except the category to which it belongs.\
\
The baseline prediction should be the anchor for further adjustments.\
\
People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the
need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs.\
\
"What is the probability of the defendant winning in cases like this
one?" His sharp answer: "Every case is unique."\
\
A proud emphasis on the uniqueness of cases is also common in medicine,
in spite of recent advances in evidence-based medicine that point the
other way.\
\
A survey of American homeowners who had remodeled their kitchens found
that, on average, they had expected the job to cost \$18,658; in fact,
they ended up paying an average of \$38,769.\
\
The greatest responsibility for avoiding the planning fallacy lies with
the decision makers who approve the plan.\
\
If they do not recognize the need for an outside view, they commit a
planning fallacy.\
\
The prevalent tendency to underweight or ignore distributional
information is perhaps the major source of error in forecasting.
Planners should therefore make every effort to frame the forecasting
problem so as to facilitate utilizing all the distributional information
that is available. This may be considered the single most important
piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting
through improved methods.\
\
Identify an appropriate reference class (kitchen renovations, large
railway projects, etc.). Obtain the statistics of the reference class
(in terms of cost per mile of railway, or of the percentage by which
expenditures exceeded budget). Use the statistics to generate a baseline
prediction. Use specific information about the case to adjust the
baseline prediction, if there are particular reasons to expect the
optimistic bias to be more or less pronounced in this project than in
others of the same type.\
\
Executives too easily fall victim to the planning fallacy. In its grip,
they make decisions based on delusional optimism rather than on a
rational weighting of gains, losses, and probabilities. They
overestimate benefits and underestimate costs. They spin scenarios of
success while overlooking the potential for mistakes and
miscalculations. As a result, they pursue initiatives that are unlikely
to come in on budget or on time or to deliver the expected returns - or
even to be completed. In this view, people often (but not always) take
on risky projects because they are overly optimistic about the odds they
face.\
\
This is an explanation of why people litigate, why they start wars, and
why they open small businesses.\
\
If you are genetically endowed with an optimistic bias, you hardly need
to be told that you are a lucky person - you already feel fortunate. An
optimistic attitude is largely inherited, and it is part of a general
disposition for well-being, which may also include a preference for
seeing the bright side of everything. If you were allowed one wish for
your child, seriously consider wishing him or her optimism. Optimists
are normally cheerful and happy, and therefore popular; they are
resilient in adapting to failures and hardships, their chances of
clinical depression are reduced, their immune system is stronger, they
take better care of their health, they feel healthier than others and
are in fact likely to live longer. A study of people who exaggerate
their expected life span beyond actuarial predictions showed that they
work longer hours, are more optimistic about their future\
\
Optimistic individuals play a disproportionate role in shaping our
lives. Their decisions make a difference; they are the inventors, the
entrepreneurs, the political and military leaders - not average people.
They got to where they are by seeking challenges and taking risks. They
are talented and they have been lucky, almost certainly luckier than
they acknowledge.\
\
The people who have the greatest influence on the lives of others are
likely to be optimistic and overconfident, and to take more risks than
they realize.\
\
These persistent (or obstinate) individuals doubled their initial losses
before giving up. Significantly, persistence after discouraging advice
was relatively common among inventors who had a high score on a
personality measure of optimism.\
\
The damage caused by overconfident CEOs is compounded when the business
press anoints them as celebrities; the evidence indicates that
prestigious press awards to the CEO are costly to stockholders. The
authors write, "We find that firms with award-winning CEOs subsequently
underperform, in terms both of stock and of operating performance. At
the same time, CEO compensation increases, CEOs spend more time on
activities outside the company such as writing books and sitting on
outside boards, and they are more likely to engage in earnings
management."\
\
To explain entrepreneurial optimism, cognitive biases play an important
role.\
\
We focus on our goal, anchor on our plan, and neglect relevant base
rates, exposing ourselves to the planning fallacy. We focus on what we
want to do and can do, neglecting the plans and skills of others. Both
in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on the
causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We are therefore
prone to an illusion of control. We focus on what we know and neglect
what we do not know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs.\
\
I have had several occasions to ask founders and participants in
innovative start-ups a question: To what extent will the outcome of your
effort depend on what you do in your firm? This is evidently an easy
question; the answer comes quickly and in my small sample it has never
been less than 80%. Even when they are not sure they will succeed, these
bold people think their fate is almost entirely in their own hands. They
are surely wrong: the outcome of a start-up depends as much on the
achievements of its competitors and on changes in the market as on its
own efforts. However, WY SIATI plays its part, and entrepreneurs
naturally focus on what they know best - their plans and actions and the
most immediate threats and opportunities, such as the availability of
funding. They know less about their competitors and therefore find it
natural to imagine a future in which the competition plays little part.\
\
Entrepreneurial firms that fail but signal new markets to more qualified
competitors "optimistic martyrs" - good for the economy but bad for
their investors.\
\
A survey in which the chief financial officers of large corporations
estimated the returns of the Standard & Poor's index over the following
year. The Duke scholars collected 11,600 such forecasts and examined
their accuracy. The conclusion was straightforward: financial officers
of large corporations had no clue about the short-term future of the
stock market; the correlation between their estimates and the true value
was slightly less than zero! When they said the market would go down, it
was slightly more likely than not that it would go up.\
\
The answer that a truthful CFO would offer is plainly ridiculous. A CFO
who informs his colleagues that "there is a good chance that the S&P
returns will be between --10% and +30%" can expect to be laughed out of
the room. The wide confidence interval is a confession of ignorance,
which is not socially acceptable for someone who is paid to be
knowledgeable in financial matters. Even if they knew how little they
know, the executives would be penalized for admitting it.\
\
The emotional, cognitive, and social factors that support exaggerated
optimism are a heady brew, which sometimes leads people to take risks
that they would avoid if they knew the odds.\
\
The contribution of optimism to good implementation is certainly
positive. The main benefit of optimism is resilience in the face of
setbacks.\
\
Someone who lacks a delusional sense of significance will wilt in the
face of repeated experiences of multiple small failures and rare
successes, the fate of most small business.\
\
When the organization has almost come to an important decision but has
not formally committed itself, Klein proposes gathering for a brief
session a group of individuals who are knowledgeable about the decision.
The premise of the session is a short speech: "Imagine that we are a
year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The
outcome was a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief
history of that disaster."\
\
Premortem has two main advantages: it overcomes the groupthink that
affects many teams once a decision appears to have been made, and it
unleashes the imagination of knowledgeable individuals in a much-needed
direction.\
\
\
============\
LOSSES\
\
We submitted our essay to Econometrica, a journal that publishes
significant theoretical articles in economics and in decision theory.
The choice of venue turned out to be important; if we had published the
identical paper in a psychological journal, it would likely have had
little impact on economics. However, our decision was not guided by a
wish to influence economics; Econometrica just happened to be where the
best papers on decision making had been published in the past, and we
were aspiring to be in that company.\
\
A single cockroach will completely wreck the appeal of a bowl of
cherries, but a cherry will do nothing at all for a bowl of
cockroaches.\
\
Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good
ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The
self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good
ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more
resistant to disconfirmation than good ones.\
\
The long-term success of a relationship depends far more on avoiding the
negative than on seeking the positive.\
\
A friendship that may take years to develop can be ruined by a single
action.\
\
The aversion to the failure of not reaching the goal is much stronger
than the desire to exceed it. People often adopt short-term goals that
they strive to achieve but not necessarily to exceed. They are likely to
reduce their efforts when they have reached an immediate goal, with
results that sometimes violate economic logic.\
\
Players would try a little harder when putting for par (to avoid a
bogey) than when putting for a birdie.\
\
Loss aversion creates an asymmetry that makes agreements difficult to
reach. The concessions you make to me are my gains, but they are your
losses; they cause you much more pain than they give me pleasure.
Inevitably, you will place a higher value on them than I do.\
\
Negotiators often pretend intense attachment to some good.\
\
Although they actually view that good as a bargaining chip and intend
ultimately to give it away in an exchange. Because negotiators are
influenced by a norm of reciprocity, a concession that is presented as
painful calls for an equally painful (and perhaps equally inauthentic)
concession from the other side.\
\
A biologist observed that "when a territory holder is challenged by a
rival, the owner almost always wins the contest - usually within a
matter of seconds."\
\
Altruistic punishment is accompanied by increased activity in the
"pleasure centers" of the brain. It appears that maintaining the social
order and the rules of fairness in this fashion is its own reward.
Altruistic punishment could well be the glue that holds societies
together.\
\
People attach values to gains and losses rather than to wealth.\
\
The fourfold pattern of preferences is considered one of the core
achievements of prospect theory.\
\
When you consider a choice between a sure loss and a gamble with a high
probability of a larger loss, diminishing sensitivity makes the sure
loss more aversive, and the certainty effect reduces the aversiveness of
the gamble.\
\
This is where people who face very bad options take desperate gambles,
accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a
small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often
turns manageable failures into disasters. The thought of accepting the
large sure loss is too painful, and the hope of complete relief too
enticing, to make the sensible decision that it is time to cut one's
losses. This is where businesses that are losing ground to a superior
technology waste their remaining assets in futile attempts to catch up.
Because defeat is so difficult to accept, the losing side in wars often
fights long past the point at which the victory of the other side is
certain.\
\
People expect to have stronger emotional reactions (including regret) to
an outcome that is produced by action than to the same outcome when it
is produced by inaction.\
\
Be explicit about the anticipation of regret. People generally
anticipate more regret than they will actually experience, because they
underestimate the efficacy of the psychological defenses they will
deploy - which they label the "psychological immune system." Their
recommendation is that you should not put too much weight on regret;
even if you have some, it will hurt less than you now think.\
\
When you see cases in isolation, you are likely to be guided by an
emotional reaction of System 1.\
\
Would you accept a gamble that offers a 10% chance to win \$95 and a 90%
chance to lose \$5? Would you pay \$5 to participate in a lottery that
offers a 10% chance to win \$100 and a 90% chance to win nothing?\
\
A bad outcome is much more acceptable if it is framed as the cost of a
lottery ticket that did not win than if it is simply described as losing
a gamble. We should not be surprised: losses evokes stronger negative
feelings than costs.\
\
Tendencies to approach or avoid are evoked by the words, and we expect
System 1 to be biased in favor of the sure option when it is designated
as KEEP and against that same option when it is designated as LOSE.\
\
Decision makers tend to prefer the sure thing over the gamble (they are
risk averse) when the outcomes are good. They tend to reject the sure
thing and accept the gamble (they are risk seeking) when both outcomes
are negative.\
\
System 1 delivers an immediate response to any question about rich and
poor: when in doubt, favor the poor.\
\
Your moral feelings are attached to frames, to descriptions of reality
rather than to reality itself.\
\
\
============\
EXPERIENCING\
\
The experiencing self is the one that answers the question: "Does it
hurt now?" The remembering self is the one that answers the question:
"How was it, on the whole?" Memories are all we get to keep from our
experience of living, and the only perspective that we can adopt as we
think about our lives is therefore that of the remembering self.\
\
Confusing experience with the memory of it is a compelling cognitive
illusion - and it is the substitution that makes us believe a past
experience can be ruined. The experiencing self does not have a voice.
The remembering self is sometimes wrong, but it is the one that keeps
score and governs what we learn from living, and it is the one that
makes decisions. What we learn from the past is to maximize the
qualities of our future memories, not necessarily of our future
experience.\
\
My happy childhood: I always cried when my mother came to tear me away
from my toys to take me to the park, and cried again when she took me
away from the swings and the slide. The resistance to interruption was a
sign I had been having a good time, both with my toys and with the
swings.\
\
At random intervals during the day, the phone presents a brief menu of
questions about what the respondent was doing and who was with her when
she was interrupted. The participant is also shown rating scales to
report the intensity of various feelings: happiness, tension, anger,
worry, engagement, physical pain, and others.\
\
The percentage of time that an individual spends in an unpleasant state
is the U-index. For example, an individual who spent 4 hours of a
16-hour waking day in an unpleasant state would have a U-index of 25%.\
\
Our emotional state is largely determined by what we attend to, and we
are normally focused on our current activity and immediate environment.\
\
To get pleasure from eating, for example, you must notice that you are
doing it.\
\
Americans were far more prone to combine eating with other activities,
and their pleasure from eating was correspondingly diluted.\
\
Priming students with the idea of wealth reduces the pleasure their face
expresses as they eat a bar of chocolate.\
\
Goals make a large difference. Nineteen years after they stated their
financial aspirations, many of the people who wanted a high income had
achieved it. Each additional point on the money-importance scale was
associated with an increment of over \$14,000 of job income.\
\
The goals that people set for themselves are so important to what they
do and how they feel about it that an exclusive focus on experienced
well-being is not tenable. We cannot hold a concept of well-being that
ignores what people want.\
\
Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking
about it. :::

The Time Paradox - by Philip Zimbardo and John Boyd
===================================================

ISBN: 1416541993\
Date read: 2009-04-03\
How strongly I recommend it: **10**/10\
**(See [my list of 200+ books](/book), for more.)**

**Go to the [Amazon
page](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=1416541993&tag=sivers-20)** for details
and reviews.

Profound idea that everyone has a primary time focus: either
Future-focused, Present-focused, or Past-focused. Fascinating
implications of each. Because I\'m so future-focused, reading this book
helped me understand people who are very present-focused. Also great
advice on shifting your focus when needed. I read it 7 years ago, but
still think about it almost every day.

my notes
--------

Just as fish may be unaware of the existence of the water in which they
swim, most of us are unaware of the ceaselessly flowing time in which we
live.\
\
How you spend today ultimately determines both your past and future.\
\
A financial planner helps to determine your investment strategy based
upon your personal investment goals. If only there were such a person to
call upon for investing time! Asking: What do you want out of life? How
can you make your time matter? What is the right use of your time?\
\
90% of the students that were late (told to rush across campus) didn\'t
stop to help a homeless person, even though they were being tested on
compassion. They were in a future-oriented mindset.\
\
Future-oriented people tend to be more successful professionally and
academically, to eat well, to exercise regularly, and to schedule
preventative doctor\'s exams. But they are the least likely to help
others in need.\
\
Present-oriented people tend to be willing to help others, but appear
less willing or able to help themselves. They\'re more likely to engage
in risky sexual behavior, to gamble, to use drugs and alcohol than
future-oriented people are. They are also less likely to exercise, eat
well, and engage in preventative health such as flossing and getting
regular exams. They are the least likely to be successful.\
\
Psychoanalysis stresses the importance of the past. Existential
psychotherapy stresses the importance of the present. Humanistic
psychotherapy stresses the importance of the future.\
\
In a typical day, you make hundreds of decisions: What to wear, what to
eat, what to do with your free time, with whom to associate, and whom to
avoid. On any given day, these decisions appear trivial, even
inconsequential. Taken as a whole, they define who you were, who you
are, and who you will become.\
\
Death is the end of a lifetime. Denial of death is a denial that time
will end. If you deny that time ends, you are likely to treat time much
differently than you would if you felt time to be scarce and of limited
duration. If you imagine your life as infinite, you are unlikely to
value time as more precious than gold and more likely to treat it as
ordinary grains of sand on a beach. Ironically, denying death relieves
anxiety and psychological stress, but it may also lead you to devalue
life, so you may life less fully.\
\
When faced with routine decisions, people conserve their thought cycles
and rely instead on mental heuristics - simple, practical rules of thumb
that we learn through trial and error. We save our judgement and
decision-making skills for thinking about the novel, unpredictable, and
dangerous forces in our lives: for predicting the future.\

Another present-oriented time zone can be called the Holistic Present.
It involves training to live one\'s life in the present moment and to
include past and future in an expanded state of focus on the present.\

Live meaningfully and fully the lives we are living right now.\
\
Robert Levine measured the pace of life in 36 American cities by
recording walking speed, bank teller speed, talking speed, and the
frequency that watches are worn. Boston, NYC and other Northeast cities
are the fastest cities in America. Southern and Western are the slowest.
Los Angeles is the slowest of all. Cities with the fastest pace of life
were the least helpful (Good Samaritan research). Los Angeles was unique
for being slowest and least helpful.\
\
\*\*\* THE PAST:\
\
Your ability to cast your time consciously in a positive light is a good
indicator of psychological and emotional health.\
\
You can reinterpret and rewrite your personal past, which can give you a
greater sense of control over the future.\
\
How we think and feel today influences how we remember yesterday.\
\
After being shown an ad talking about the wonders of Disneyland,
including shaking hands with Bugs Bunny, people were asked about their
own memories of visiting Disneyland. 16 percent vividly remembered
shaking hands with Bugs Bunny, even though there\'s no Bugs Bunny at
Disneyland. (He\'s a Warner Brothers character.)\
\
It\'s not the events of the past that most strongly influence our lives.
Our attitude toward events in the past matter more than the events
themselves.\

\"To be able to enjoy one\'s past is to live twice.\" - Martial (1st
century Roman poet)\
\
If the people in a culture that uses the past to evaluate current
situations share a past trauma, they are likely to want revenge.\
To the extent that people share positive views of the past, they seek to
maintain the status quo culturally and politically.\
In a global economy, nations that live in the past will be left behind.\
\
Those with most involvement with their families are highly
past-positive.\
\
\
\*\*\* THE PRESENT:\
\
Our lives start with a natural focus on the present, but some people
continue to focus on present biological stimulation into adulthood,
responding only to events happening in their immediate physical and
social environment.\
\
Some present information is needed to enjoy life. Too much present
orientation can rob life of happiness.\
\
People in volatile economies do not invest. Political and economic
instability also causes instability within families and causes people to
trust only what they can hold in their hands. The development of a
future orientation requires stability and consistency in the present.\
\
Less educated people are more likely to live in the present. Societies
that offer less opportunity for education are likely to have more
citizens whose focus is limited to the present.\
\
When women\'s educational level advances, their children and social
class also advance.\
\
Ambition and a need for achievement drive a future orientation that
focuses on work, savings, and planning for a continually better life
through one\'s efforts.\
\
Present-oriented top athletes or rock stars also worked hard for their
money, but many also retained a present perspective that biases them
toward addictive behaviors.\
\
Robert Levine fascinating book: A Geography of Time\
\
Hedonistic people enjoy all things that yield pleasure and avoid things
that cause pain. Beyond passive enjoyment, hedonists actively seek
pleasure. They arrange their choices in life around activities and
relationships that are pleasurable, arousing, stimulating, exciting, and
novel. They focus on immediate gratification, self-stimulation, and
short-term payoffs. Such people avoid people and situations that are
tedious, that require high effort and maintenance, or that are
regularized or boring. They are playful and impulsive at all ages,
undertaking play and pleasant leisure activities for their intrinsic
worth and continuing them as long as they do not become boring.\
\
On the negative side, they are likely to have undercontrolled egos, to
prefer inconsistency in their lives, to have weak impulse control, and
to be less conscientious and emotionally stable than others. On the
positive side, they make good friends, lovers, and party guests. They
enjoy other people as a source of stimulation, as long as the others are
not boring.\
\
(Phil Z tripping:) The sensual sensations occurred only when his time
sense was expanded.\
\
The present perspective has both good and bad effects, though the good
generally offset the bad. Hedonists live active high-intensity lives,
filled with as much excitement, novelty, and spontaneity as possible.
They engage in diverse activities, sports, and hobbies. They learn early
to make friends and lovers easily and frequently, and are apt to fill
their lives with people whom they find stimulating and with possessions
they can show off. If they have enough money, they take great joy in
living, appreciating nature, animals, and people around them. People
like to be with them because, like children, they have an open-eyed
readiness to connect and an intensity that comes from being totally in
the moment. The demands of the to-do list never dilute their
here-and-now. They generally do not make lists, and when they do, forget
to check them.\
\
Sensuality is central. They are always open to sensory input, taking
time to smell the proverbial roses and to touch.\
\
Future-oriented folks can also become totally absorbed in their work:
get into the flow.\
Characteristics of FLOW:\
• Clear goals\
• Concentrating and focusing\
• Loss of self-consciousness\
• Distorted sense of time\
• Balance between ability level and challenge (not too easy or too
hard)\
• Personal control over the situation or activity\
• The activity is intrinsically rewarding, so there\'s an effortlessness
of action\
\
Flow is involvement in the process of whatever you are doing. When in
flow, you are not focused on the product of the process in which you are
engaged. When we are concerned about the product, we worry about how it
will be judged, evaluated, accepted, and rejected.\
\
Painting: Half the group was told they would be judged, half told to
focus on process. Present hedonists painting in the process condition
were most creative. Futures painting in the product condition produced
paintings with the most technical merit.\
\
Immediate large rewards that result in large delayed punishments and
overall net loss: has the effect like reverse binoculars, making the
future small and remote, not allowing it to affect current decisions and
actions.\
\
Programs like DARE focus on aversive future consequences that work for
future-oriented people but not for present-oriented: the target
audience. They focus on personal willpower, which fails to recognize
powerful situational and social forces in the present behavioral context
that influence Hedonists and Fatalists more than they do others.\

\
\*\*\*\* THE FUTURE:\
\
Ratomir Dujkovic brought to the present-oriented Ghana team a Balkan
discipline that featured a highly focused future time perspective and
insistence on discipline. Instilled discipline, toughness, goal-scoring
and puntuality most important. High expectations of future success. When
they combined their present-oriented creativity with their newfound
future desire to win, they came in eighth-finals for World Cup, only
losing to Brazil (2006).\
\
(( DEREK\'S NOTE: I\'ve emails from at least 10 different people,
telling me this info is not correct. Please, no need to do that again.
The details of the example don\'t matter. ))\
\
The mantra of a Future is \"meet tomorrow\'s deadline, complete all the
necessary work before tonight\'s play\". Futures consider work a source
of special pleasure. Tomorrow\'s anticipated gains and losses fuel
today\'s decisions and actions.\
\
Unlike their Hedonistic peers who live in their bodies, the Futures live
in their minds, envisioning other selves, scenarios, rewards, and
successes.\
\
The soccer team\'s belief in its own strength and high level of
performance: they believed that they could influence the future by
working hard in the present.\
\
When you want to achieve something and you believe that you can, you
work harder.\
\
Environment that creates Future-oriented people:\
• living in a temperate zone\
• living in a stable family\
• being Protestant or Jewish\
• becoming educated\
• being a young or middle-aged adult\
• having a job\
• using technology regularly\
• being successful\
• having future-oriented role models\
• recovering from childhood illness\
\
Preparing for seasonal change involves planning, so people become used
to anticipating worse weather in winter and summer. Living in a mildly
tropical climate is being in paradise with an extended lease.\
\
Early repeated failure breeds a sense of helplessness and makes you shun
that area of performance where you failed.\
\
Learning that a hero became successful through hard work, effort,
practice, and self-denial in order to pursue a dream inspires emulation
of that person.\
\
MAZE: When challenged to solve puzzles as quickly as they could, the
Presents and Futures responded very differently. The Presents started
immediately from the start, moving their pencils through the maze. The
Futures did not move at all at first, looking for the goal, then working
backwards to the starting point, checking out dead ends en route. The
Futures always won.\
\
People discontinue physical rehabilitation because it hurts more to do
the regimen than to quit it. Futures endure the pain for the short term
because of the long-term gain it provides.\
\
Futures are competitive when negotiating deals or arguing.\
\
Tragedy of the commons: the selfish prevail over the farsighted because
shorter-term individual yields would be greater than the communal,
longer-term gain. The common good is not a moral matter but a
time-perspective matter.\

Mentally rehearse reaching goals. Focus on the outcome. Rehearse the
individual steps, step-by-step.\
\
\
\*\*\*\* TRANSCENDENTAL FUTURE:\
\
Because there is no possibility of contradictory evidence, belief in the
transcendental future may be especially resistant to change.\
\
\"In every deliberation, we must consider the impact on the 7th
generation, even if it requires having skin as thick as the bark of a
pine.\" - Iroquois Indian saying.\
\
We will win the war on terror not by destroying our enemy\'s future but
by nurturing it. The motivational power of the mundane future must be
restored if mundane future goals are to compete with
transcendental-future goals. Only by building a mundane future full of
hope, optimism, respect, health, and prosperity can the motivational
power of the transcendental future be balanced.\
\
Doing so requires replacing past-negatives and present-fatalistic time
perspectives with past-positive and present-hedonistic ones. We have to
respect people for their pasts and allow them to enjoy the present.
Provide adequate resources and opportunities to those who lack them:
food, shelter, money, education, employment, recreation, relaxation, and
community celebration. Instill a sense of personal responsibility for
seizing a desirable opportunity. Individual initiative must be
encouraged and rewarded. Supplementing transcendental-future time
perspectives with more practical future time perspectives. (Expecting
people to change their transcendental-future beliefs is insulting and
exacerbates conflict.) Offer hope, opportunity, and fulfillment in the
future on the way to the Promised Land. The development of a future time
perspective requires stable political, economic, and family conditions.
People must believe that their actions today will lead to predictable
and desirable rewards in the future.\
\
\
\*\*\* TIME, BODY, HEALTH\
\
Circadian rhythm comes from Latin \"circa\" (around) \"dies\" (day) :
means \"about a day\".\
\
Car accidents increase by 10% the day after clocks are set forward in
the spring, and decrease by a smaller amount the day after clocks are
set back in the fall.\
\
Dangerous events often restrict time perspective to the present. Under
acute stress, refugees narrowed their view to a highly focused present.\
\
Fear and excitement heighten our present awareness, sharpen our
instincts, and help us survive.\
\
Emotions deal with the present. Thinking prepares for the future.\
\
Depressed people look not to the future but to the past to relieve their
depression. They feel that rehashing and rehearsing the causes of their
symptoms will somehow help to solve their problems. This quickly
deteriorates into a vicious downward spiral that exacerbates the
severity and length of depression.\
\
An obsessive focus on the past makes people less able to think about the
future. Maintaining past-negative attitudes by thinking and talking
about them repeatedly is not a good strategy. Put the past to rest and
build on it the vision of a better future.\
\
Women on Dr. Phil\'s show: had never consciously chosen to be fat, but
then had chosen what they ate from a purely present-oriented
perspective, without regard for consequences.\
\
\
\*\*\* TIME AND MONEY\
\
The ability to delay gratification at age 4 is twice as good a predictor
of later SAT scores as IQ.\
\
Your chronological time - time passed since birth - is as relevant as
your sense of the time remaining until your death.\
\
Anything that constrains our sense of an unlimited future shifts our
motivations and priorities away from future goals and toward present
emotional satisfaction. A limited future encourages us to make choices
that enhance our positive emotional state rather than, for instance, to
pursue an education or other future-oriented activity. Because older
people anticipate a limited future, they are more apt to do what feels
good - from speaking their minds to travelling to making dramatic
changes in their lives. The same may be said for anyone who is in a
situation that portends an uncertain future or clearly defined end, such
as having a terminal disease or losing a job.\
\
We regulate our emotions to try to maintain a sense of overall
well-being. When you imagine that you have a lot of time left, you use
it to learn more about the world, meet new people, and experience
novelty. When a life\'s time is short, its goals become more short-term.
Those who anticipate a long-term future say \"more is better\" and look
to spend time with a lot of different people and new acquaintances.
Those who anticipate a short future is \"quality not quantity\", and
they choose to spend quality time with fewer people.\
\
Men who have not established a convoy of buddies (a reliable group of
friends) by early adulthood may never do so, and may go through life
with few or no close friends.\
\
Seek knowledge about yourself and your world. Look for help doing so
from a range of experts and variety of acquaintances.\
\
Learning to control impulses and make better choices is inextricably
connected with being aware of one\'s internal states and with managing
feelings rather than acting them out. Emotions rather than reason tend
to drive the behavior of people who have poor impulse control.
Impulsivity is the hallmark of present-hedonistic adolescents, but many
carry it over into adulthood.\
\
Thrill wins over will.\
\
We sometimes delude ourselves that we proceed in a rational manner and
weigh all of the pros and cons of various alternatives. But this is
seldom the actual case. Quite often "I decided in favor of X" is no more
than "I liked X". We buy the cars we like, choose the jobs and houses we
find attractive, then justify these choices by various reason.\
\
If we always chose the consequences of our actions when we chose those
actions, none of us would be fat, drink, smoke, or fail examinations by
not studying. Future-oriented people believe that when you choose a
behavior, you choose its future consequences. But sometimes you do not
choose a behavior. Sometimes a behavior chooses you based upon the
environment in which you find yourself.\
\
Queen Elizabeth said she\'d \"trade all my possessions for a moment of
time\". There were no takers.\
\
Pasts are more interested in preserving money. Present Fatalists treat
money as though it doesn\'t matter. Hedonists use their money to create
fun and excitement. Futures feel time and money denote possibilities for
the future.\
\
\
\*\*\* LOVE AND HAPPINESS\
\
Couples with mismatched time perspectives will be prone to
miscommunication and misunderstanding.\
\
How do you bridge the gap in the languages of time? You start with the
present. The present is the bridge from the past to the future. The
present is the meeting place for good as well as difficult times. When
two people are arguing, they can be tempted to leave the bridge of the
present and become lost in the fog of the past or imagined future,
losing their connection.\
\
By always looking through the present to the next goal, you likely do
not fully appreciate the present.\
\
Read Sonka Lyubomirsky\'s book \"The How of Happiness\" and Martin
Seligman\'s \"Authentic Happiness\".\
\
Buddhist student worked for years to see the master. Ascended to a
mountaintop and waited for days. The master finally acknowledged the
student by asking, \"At the beginning of the trail that leads to this
mountaintop, there is a sign on one side of the trail. On which side is
it?\" Mindfulness matters more than abstract knowledge.\
\
\"Success is a peace of mind which is a direct result of
self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best that
you are capable of becoming.\" - John Wooden\
\
Identify the things in your life that make you happy, and do more of
them.\
Identify the things in your life that make you unhappy, and do less of
them.\
\
By being mindful, you may be able to detect the influence of your
environment with you want to be rid of it.\
\
\
\*\*\* BUSINESS, POLITICS AND TIME:\
\
(Enron:) Greed dissolved future orientation and replaced it with a
present orientation that excluded the prospect of getting caught.\
\
Great leaders are able to become completely engrossed in the present and
to harness the passion they generate in the service of future goals.
They have a unique ability to be fully in the moment and to make an
audience feel that they are the exclusive focus of their attention. Then
they use the energy they generate by their present focus to create a
compelling vision of the future.\
\
The unexpected occurs when the future doesn\'t turn out the way you
thought it would. The unexpected can signal unexpected success or
unexpected failure. Both have their virtues.\
\
When the unexpected chance event happens, it is more likely that
future-oriented people will understand what it means and how to
capitalize on it, because they have already invested in education and
have learned to focus on contingencies and causal thinking. They can
quickly go from \"aha\" to \"so that\'s it!\" because they are prepared
to take the new and put it in familiar old molds or create new ones that
fit better.\
\
Future goals can help us avoid the urgent-new trap. Once we\'ve
determined whether we want fame, fortune, happiness, excitement, quiet,
comfort, some, or all of the above, then we can decide how to best spend
our time achieving them.\
\
People are generally risk-averse in the domain of gains. This means that
people avoid risk after having secured a sure gain.\
\
Students: Ill-defined and unrealistic goals (brain surgeon, rock star,
NBA superstar) were replaced with specific well-defined goals that they
could reasonably meet.\
\
When a person does not have a concept of the future or believes there is
no future for him, the future cannot be taken from him.\
\
\
\*\*\* RESETTING YOUR CLOCK\
\
\"To achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan, and not quite
enough time.\" - Leonard Bernstein\
\
The optimal time perspective profile is:\
- high in past-positive\
- moderately high in future\
- moderately high in present-hedonistic\
- low in past-negative\
- low in present-fatalistic\
\
Choose the time perspective most appropriate for each situation. Open
your eyes to the full range of human experience. Depending on the
demands of a situation, one time perspective must take precedence, while
others may temporarily recede. When you have work to finish, the future
time perspective comes to the forefront. When your work is done, and
it\'s time for pleasure, the present-hedonistic time perspective will
surface. During the holidays, the past-positive time perspective is most
appropriate for preparing you to enjoy family customs.\
\
Self actualizing person: Tie the past and the future to the present in
meaningful continuity. Not burdened by guilts, regrets, and resentments.
Aspirations are tied meaningfully to present working goals. Faith in the
future without rigid or over-idealistic goals.\
\
\
\*\*\* OUT OF TIME\
\
The Golden Rule of time: Use your time as you would like others to use
theirs.\
\
\
\*\*\* GREAT SUMMARY FROM AN AMAZON REVIEWER:\
\
Past-oriented people:\
1- They are generally more concerned with their past and seem to be able
to distance themselves from the realities of the present or the future.\
2- They usually tend to be traditional, religious, and conservative.\
3- They have a stable sense of self.\
4- They usually tend to be family- and group-oriented and are
distrustful of strangers; thus they may have a tendency to be
prejudiced.\
5- They usually focus on their obligations and commitments whether
personal or collective (i.e. family, cultural, or tribal obligations).\
6- Rituals and myths play important roles in their lives.\
7- They may have guilt as a dominant feeling.\
8- They usually try to maintain the status quo and thus may not be
progressive.\
9- They usually do not take risks and are not adventurous.\
10- Within their group, they usually tend to be dependent and
cooperative rather than competitive.\
\
Present-oriented people:\
1- They tend to focus on the present and their current sensations,
feelings, and concerns while ignoring commitments made in the past or
for the future; thus they are more concerned with \"what is\" than
\"what was\" or \"what may be\".\
2- Their thinking is more concrete rather than abstract (i.e. one
hundred dollar right now is much better than two hundred dollars in the
future).\
3- It is difficult for them to give up temptations or delay
gratification and thus they are easily distracted from the performance
of necessary current tasks and tend to be procrastinators.\
4- They tend to concentrate on activities that bring pleasure and avoid
pain.\
5- Their knowledge or insight may not deter them from performing actions
that may not be beneficial to them.\
6- They are usually more sensation and novelty seekers, more aggressive,
more depressed, less conscientious, and less emotionally stable. They
have less concern for future consequences, less ego and impulse control,
and less preference for consistency. They also tend to lie.\
7- Usually people who are poor or uneducated tend to be present-oriented
since they usually tend to focus on emergent needs of the present.\
8- Since they are not good in abstract thinking, are more concerned with
immediate gratification, and less concerned about the future, they
usually tend to get low grades in school.\
9- Because they are immediate pleasure seekers, they usually don\'t pay
good attention to their health and can additionally abuse substances.\
10- They are usually considered to be fun people to be around.\
\
Future-oriented people:\
1- They are more focused on their future than the present or the past;
their thoughts are concerned with the future consequences of their
present actions; they logically analyze various outcomes that may result
from their action.\
2- They are goal-oriented and can delay gratification and endure an
unpleasant situation in order to achieve long-term goals. They pay
attention to responsibility, liability, efficiency, distant payoffs, and
tend to optimize future outcomes. Thus they can work hard and avoid
temptations, distractions, waste of time to accomplish a goal. They
usually tend to rehearse various future plans.\
3- Since they are concerned about the future, they tend to save their
money and resources.\
4- They could be either cooperative or competitive depending on which
action results in the best outcome.\
5- They tend to be health-conscious in order to prevent future negative
health outcomes.\
6- They may be unable to enjoy fun activities due to the fear of wasting
time.\
7- They may have difficulty in intimate relationships since they thrive
on control, predictability, and consistency, factors that may interfere
with the freedom and spontaneity of relationships.\
8- Although they usually have low anxiety levels, concern for the future
may increase their anxiety. They usually tend to be workaholic, and have
midlife crises.\
9- They tend to be more conscientious, less aggressive, less depressed,
more reward-dependent, less sensation seeker, more studious, more
creative, and use less addictive drugs and alcohol.\
10- They tend to have more self-esteem, energy, openness, ego-control,
and grade-point average.\
\
Time paradoxes:\
Four main paradoxes are:\
1- Time is one of the most powerful influences on our thoughts,
feelings, and actions, yet we are usually totally unaware of the affect
of time in our lives.\
2- We can buy food, objects, space (i.e. land), but not time. Once we
lose time, we lose it forever.\
3- Each specific attitude toward time\--or time perspective\--is
associated with numerous benefits, yet in excess each is associated with
even greater costs.\
4- Individual attitudes toward time are learned through personal
experience, yet collectively attitudes toward time influence national
destinies. :::
